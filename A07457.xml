            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>ſtreſſe of life, and the meſſenger of antiquitie. For without Hiſtories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what certaintie can we haue of things paſt? what truth of things ſpoken and done in former ages? howe voyde ſhoulde our memorie bee of the knowledge of ſo many notable things, which hapned before our dayes? and then what skill or vſe could there bee of things altogether vnknowne? We ſhould as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren paſſe ouer our life, ignorant of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend antiquitie. Now then, if euery Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie faithfully committed to writing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth this prayſe, and glorieth worthily in theſe titles, howe much more may wee truely ſay, that the ſacred Hiſtories onely,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4708:8"/>
are free from all ſuſpition, which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by the Spirite of God, written by the Prophets, and carefully preſerued in the Church: which ſette before our eyes the true originall of all things, teach the beginning and order of times, lay downe the truth of all things paſt, ſtirre vp in vs, and refreſh the memorie of works, both humane and diuine, and propoſe vnto vs ſound examples, by which we may frame our whole life to the true knowledge and ſincere worſhip of God? Adde hereunto, that the ſtate of the Church is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs by the ſame Hiſtories, and that the enemies of the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her fights and ſufferings, Gods manifold ſuccours, and at the laſt, the full deliuerances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are in them plainely ſet downe to her view. Amongſt all the reſt, this Hiſtorie of <hi>Eſter,</hi> which by Gods fauor we take in hand, doth propoſe vnto vs, euen as in a glaſſe, the wonderful prouidence of God, in preſeruing, cheriſhing, and defending his Church: then againe, the treacheries and cruell mindes of her moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and laſt of all, the carefulneſſe and dutie of the godly, as well at all other times, as then principally, when dangers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4708:9"/>
hang ouer their heads, and threaten vnto them all extremitie. The name of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour is vnknowne, neither doth it much auaile vs to know who wrote it (as in ſuch like Hiſtories of the <hi>Iudges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi>) ſo that we know that it is ſacred and diuine, and hath been ſo taken and receiued alwaies in the Church of God: ſith the holy ghoſt hath engrauen it in the hearts of the faithfull by ſufficient teſtimonies. This Hiſtorie therefore bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for title the name of <hi>Eſter,</hi> (becauſe <hi>Eſter</hi> was as a principall inſtrument, which God did vſe for the deliuerance of his Church, when it was like vtterly to haue bin deſtroyed in her time, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the prouinces of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi>) is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this note of diuine maieſtie and vndoubted truth, and layde vp in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongſt the holy monuments, for the inſtruction and conſolation of the Church, throughout all ages. For as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>VVhatſoeuer things are written afore time, are written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope.</hi> For ſo notable and extraordinarie deliuerances of the Church of God, at ſundrie times,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4708:9"/>
and in diuers manners, were not gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither and committed to writing, without the ordinance and direction of Gods diuine prouidence: but that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently beholding howe great a care the Lord hath alwayes had of his people, and with how vnwearied endeuour hee hath brought vnto them preſent helpe in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtreſſe: we may learne to place our hope in him alone, and to reſt our ſelues onely on him, whoſe goodneſſe and truth endureth for euer.</p>
               <p>The time when theſe things happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was in the raigne of <hi>Aſſuerus:</hi> but who this <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> was, or at what time he raigned, it is not agreed vppon by all writers: yet notwithſtanding by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of other places of holy Scripture, in which mention is made of <hi>Aſsuerus,</hi> as <hi>Eſra</hi> 4. 6. it appeareth that this <hi>Aſsue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is hee, whom the prophane Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians call <hi>Darius,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hyſtaſpis,</hi> which after the death of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had obtained the Kingdome. Wherefore, whereas this Hiſtorie ſetteth down a rehearſall from the third yeare of the raigne of <hi>Aſsuerus,</hi> and the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Haman</hi> falles out the twelfth yeare:

                  </gap>ad leaue to returne out of the captiuitie into they rowne Countrey.

So that there were but only tenne yeares paſt from the eſtabliſhment of the Monarch of the Perſians and Medes, when <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> got the Kingdome, in whoſe twelfth yeare this conſpiracie happened. But then it muſt needes bee that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> muſt bee verie olde, becauſe as wee ſhall heare in the ſeconde Chapter, hee was carried into Captiuitie with <hi>Iechoniah,</hi> from which time vnto this, there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more then foure ſcore yeares. But the Lorde as often as the neceſſitie of his Church hath ſo required, hath preſerued certaine men ſtrong and ſounde for that purpoſe. And let theſe things ſuffice to haue beene ſpoken of the time.

For you ſhall ſee many who not only feaſt certain daies, but ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the whole time of their life in ſuch exceſſe. And are not many priuate men alſo wont to do the like, who haue none other care whiles they liue, then to fill their paunch, and prouide for their belly? euen as they are ſaid in this life to reioyce themſelues, and to bee prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their flatterers whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make much of themſelues. To them appertaineth the example of the wicked rich man, as though<note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 18. Luc. 15.</note> they did liue to eate and drinke, whereas we muſt eate and drinke to liue, and to be able to imploy our ſelues in our vocation. Eſpecially Kings and their officers, who ought to be examples vnto their ſubiects
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4708:25"/>
of all vertues. But what can be aright in ſo great wantonneſſe and ryot? But ſo they liue for the moſt part by the iuſt iudgment of God the reuenger, becauſe the people make themſelues vnworthy of good kings and wiſe councellors. The other feaſt vnto which all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people that were in <hi>Suſa</hi> were inuited, laſted only ſeuen dayes: yet was it long inough: for it is a great matter for a whole citie to giue themſelues to eating and drinking &amp; to paſtimes, ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. So when great men begin once to giue themſelues vnto ryot, they are drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it more and more, deſiring to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all others in the like. This bidding of the whole people, doth teſtifie not onely the kings liberalitie &amp; bountie, but his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie &amp; kindneſſe, a vertue moſt beſeeming kings. And ſurely this gentlenes &amp; curteſie is ſo much the more to be comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in ſo great a Monarch: becauſe the greater part of Princes at this day, who yet are farre from the power of this King, do make no more account of theyr ſubiects then of baſe bondmen: ſo that they will ſcarſly ſuffer themſelues to bee ſeene by them, vnleſſe it be to be honoured.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4708:26"/>
yet might he better haue beſtowed his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie. For the bountie beſtowed vpon the bellie, ſcarce laſteth any longer then whiles it is full: and that which is ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallie ſpent without choyſe vpon all, binds no man: and is rather to bee accounted waſte and prodigalitie, then liberalitie or beneficence. Yet is it not vnfitting the office of a King, or vnſeemely for them ſometime to exerciſe liberalitie towardes their ſubiects, not neglecting any: for they are Kings aſwel of the ſmall as of the great: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the baſer ſort eſpeciallie are they to powre out the effects of their munificence and humanitie, euen as wee ſee the Sunne no leſſe to ſende out his rayes vpon the vile and abiect, then vpon the high and hautie. So the holy Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> in times paſt were liberall &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful toward the people, which were wont to keepe holyday and reioyce ſeuen daies togither during the feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles:</hi> but their ioy was conſecrated vnto God, with a ſolemne remembraunce of his benefits. VVhen God then giues reſt and abilitie, it is lawfull to banquet many dayes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that all laſciuiouſnes be baniſhed, and God worſhipped and acknowledged
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4708:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the authour of that ioy and reſt. So that if this King had regard of Iuſtice, and did gouerne all things orderly and vprightly, this liberalitie was commendable. But if the people were oppreſſed with tributes and exactions, or otherwiſe hardly dealt withall, this was but a meanes to comfort a while their miſerie, and to haue them after more readie and obedient. Manie Kings nowe a dayes thinke it ſufficient to ſeede their people with faire words, which they are woont to publiſh in writing, that they may perſwade the poor ſubiects, that they night and day ſtudie for their profite: whereas notwithſtanding this is for the moſt part their onely care, by what means to wring mony from them, ſucke out their wealth, and haue them obedient to euerie commaund. So that thoſe people are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, which either are ſubiect to good kings, or without Kings enioy their owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And thoſe Kings and Gouernours are alſo wiſe and happie, who haue learned to gouerne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their people with iuſtice and clemencie, after the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who excellently teacheth, that it is not enough for a King to winne his ſubiects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with feaſtes, but that iuſtice and mercie are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4708:27"/>
required in him principally, for their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Of which roial vertues ſee more in the three ſcore and twelft Pſalme. And thus farre of the Kings feaſts.</p>
               <p>Let vs now come in like ſort to the feaſt which the Queene <hi>Vaſhti</hi> made for the women: in the kings houſe alſo, but not in the Court, as did <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth women rather to keep themſelues within doores, then to go to banquetting abroade. Great was the authoritie of this queene <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> for that ſhe was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the firſt Monarch of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, and ſiſter of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> who in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond emperor, and then wife of this <hi>Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who was the thirde king of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchie. Shee therefore obſerued the like order in entertaining the women, as her husband did toward the men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the king entertained his Princes which hee had called out of all his Empire with coſtly feaſts, ſo the queene banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together with the Ladies which were come with their husbandes out of diuerſe prouinces. And as he feaſted the men that dwelt in <hi>Suſan,</hi> ſeuen dayes, ſo did the queene the women, that the ioy might
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4708:27"/>
be great on both partes. For otherwiſe it had beene but halfe a pleaſure, if the men had feaſted with the King, no regarde at all beeing had of the women. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſeemeth voyde of all equitie, that the men giuing themſelues to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and feaſting, ſhoulde leaue all the trouble and care vpon their wiues, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their houſholde affaires. As the men therefore were diligent in deuiſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe paſtimes (as they are tearmed) to paſſe away, or that I may ſpeake more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to looſe their time: the women no doubt were not behinde in inuenting of ſportes and toyes for their delights, ſeeing women are no leſſe giuen to pleaſure then men. But you will ſay why did they ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet apart from their husbandes, ſeeing nowe a dayes you ſhall not ſee any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant feaſts, vnleſſe the women be bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the men, nay for the moſt part the banquettes are made for their ſakes, as the manners of our age are moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and more bent to greater licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe? I ſay, that the cuſtome of thoſe tymes was more honeſt and modeſt, that in publique feaſtes the women ſhoulde not banquet with the men, that by this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4708:28"/>
meanes the occaſion of many allurements vnto wantonneſſe might be cut off. For I pray, what chaſtitie can remaine vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in drunkenneſſe and intemperancie, in filthie and wanton lookes and ſpeeches, and oftentimes ſcarce honeſt touchings? And woulde to God at this day this lawe were in force amongſt thoſe nations which delight ſo much to banquet with women, and to ſpende the time in dauncing with them. For howe vnhoneſt a cuſtome hath preuailed amongeſt ſome, to carrie other mens wiues and maidens to the Tauernes? For how is it poſſible, that in the ſchooles of all impudencie, ſuch as the Tauerns are, honeſtie &amp; chaſtitie can be preſerued, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie in that licence which euery man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto himſelfe among the portes: when as euen in the moſt holie places, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie beholde both women and maydes, with vnchaſte eyes? Is not this the full meaſure of all miſchiefe, that thoſe who are well heate with wine, ſhould get them to daunce, where nothing is heard but wanton Muſicke, nothing ſeene but moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons full of intiſement: where finallie there is full libertie to doo and ſay what you lyſt? Farre awaye let all this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4708:28"/>
bee, and let vs learne at the leaſt of the wretched heathen, ſome lawes and examples of modeſtie: ſeeing eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially wee ſee the matter come to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, that the horſe feeleth no longer the bitte, and there is now no more place left for admonitions or reproofes drawne out of the pure word of God.</p>
               <p>Some things therefore are praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie in theſe feaſts of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> to wit, his liberality towards his Nobles, his courteſie and gentleneſſe towardes all the people that dwelt at <hi>Suſa;</hi> the law alſo ſet downe by him, that no man ſhould be compelled to drinke without thirſt; and laſtly, that honeſt modeſt ſeparation of the men from the women in banquetting. But there are again not a few things faultie in the ſame, to wit, that vaine oſtentation of his glorie and riches, the great loſſe of time in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and banquetting, that ouer great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and ſpending of his goods, the too much careleſneſſe of neceſſarie affayres, which could not but fall out to bee many, and of no ſmall weight, within ſo large an Empire, in the ſpace of ſixe moneths: and eſpeciallie the contempt of the true God, who is neither acknowledged nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4708:29"/>
by theſe feaſters: and finally that prophane mirth and gladneſſe without any note of holyneſſe, which ought prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to ſhine among the faithful: ſo that it was not much to be maruailed at, that the iſſue was ſo mournefull, as God gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we ſhall ſee. VVherefore if we deſire to haue our ioy and mirth continue long, and haue it ioyned with Gods bleſſing, let vs beginne with calling vpon his name, and let vs end with the ſame: yea, let vs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the whole courſe of our life to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For therfore are we borne, that when we haue ſerued him in this world, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him the glorie that is due, wee may at the laſt be made partakers of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ioyes with him in heauen,</p>

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:4708:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>In this rage the King asketh the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Councellours, what they thinke may bee done to <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> by the lawe. It is prayſe worthie, to aske the aduiſe of wiſe men, and for an angrie man to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare their opinion: but it is to bee feared, leaſt hee kindle his Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours with his ouer-great heate, becauſe oftentimes wee ſee it happen, how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one dooth frame his affections to the kings humour, and giues him counſaile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his paſſion.

               <p>But in proceſſe of time many kings giue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4708:36"/>
themſelues ſuch libertie, that they abuſe the name of their counſellors, to get the greater authoritie to their owne wilfull decrees. For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it commeth to paſſe, that great power cannot long abide any peere. Thoſe ſeauen who heere are named, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with excellent titles, <hi>Of wiſe men, which knew the times, and were skilfull in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and iudgement.</hi> And truely theſe gifts are verie requiſite in Kings counſellors. For by their wiſedome and diſcreete coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, profitable lawes and ſtatutes are made, as wel in peace as in warre: by them the whole kingdome is gouerned: they diſpoſe of all matters, both publique and priuate.

In all which there is required great wiſedome, long experience, &amp; exquiſite knowledge of the lawes. True wiſedome containeth the knowledge of things both diuine and humane, and of their cauſes alſo. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe men had not attayned the knowledge of the true God, they were

Next, the knowledge of the times is attributed vnto them, which containeth the skill in Hiſtories, out of which may bee drawne the examples of memorable acts in all ages: to which muſt be adioyned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, a ſurer inſtructor a great deale then Hiſtories, which affoordeth ſounde counſaile, according to the varietie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of occurrents.

women ſhould afterward become diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, or ſtubburne againſt their husbands, but euery man ſhould be ruler in his owne houſe. The ende of this decree was good and commendable, but the manner of the proceeding vnlawfull, and no proportion or equalitie obſerued betweene the fault and the puniſhment: and therefore no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde had either of iuſtice, or of publique commoditie: which will better appeare by the diligent conſideration of euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.

               <p>Lo then this is the queſtion propoſed by the King to be deliberated of <hi>what ſhall bee done, according to the Lawe to the Queene <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſhti: becauſe ſhe fulfilled not the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the King Aſſuerus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell when they had well drunke? or whiles the king was yet inflamed with wine, and incenſed with anger? For as yet his wrath was not aſſwaged, as appeareth by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4708:40"/>
of the councel, and thoſe things which expreſly are ſpoken in the beginning of the next Chapter. Beſides, is not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great weight ouer-haſfily hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when he wil haue ſentence giuen euen in their banquet? Moreouer, what iuſtice was it to giue iudgement againſt ſo noble a perſonage, the cauſe being neuer heard? ſeeing there is none ſo vile or abiect, who can bee condemned in the equitie of any lawe, either diume or humane, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither he hath pleaded his cauſe, neither is lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuict? Laſt of all, euen by the lawe of nations, euery man is to be heard in his own cauſe, before he be condemned. Firſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould haue enquired whether the matter were worthie to be called into conſultation: which if it ſhould be found ſo to bee, then both the day ſhould haue bene aſſigned, and a conuenient place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the partie accuſed, called: if this had bene done, that ioyfull meeting of theirs had not bene turned into ſo wofull a tragedie. He deſireth indeed that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queene <hi>Vaſhti</hi> ſhould be iudged according to the lawes, but the contempt of lawes in this action, ſufficiently ſheweth that he maketh mention of the lawes, onely for faſhions

ſake. So for the moſt part, Kings are vvont to talke of lawes &amp; ſtatutes, as though they would ſubmit themſelues vnto them: but indeede they meane to haue their will to ſtand for reaſon, and their paſſion to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the place of iudgement. So euerie one that goeth to lavv, pretendeth law &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vvhich the greater part of them haue an hundreth times broken, or at the leaſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their own commodity. So thoſe who ſit in the place of gouernment, wil ſeeme to ſpeake nothing but lawe and ſtatutes, which notwithſtanding for the moſt part they wreſt and alter as they liſt. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this ſaying of the Kings, if it bee rightly vnderſtood, preſcribeth a rule, whereby all controuerſies as wel ciuil as Eccleſiaſtical, may bee compounded. For vvhereas vve liue ſo heere vppon this earth, by reaſon of the infirmitie of man, that it cannot be but that ſtrife vvil ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ariſe, they muſt all bee iudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lavve.</p>
               <p>VVherefore it behooueth, that in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Iudges haue the lavves alvvaies before theyr eyes, and diligently enquire of the cauſe and euerie circumſtaunce thereof, as <hi>Iob</hi> proteſteth of himſelfe,

And thus farre of the queſtion propounded by the King.</p>
               <p>Let vs now then heare the ſentence of <hi>Memuchan,</hi> one of the councell, who was laſt recited, but ſpeaketh firſt: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was the yongeſt, or elſe the King commaunded him firſt to ſhewe his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

and Media, that it be not tranſgreſſed: That the queene Vaſhti come no more into the kings preſence, and let the King giue her kingdome vnto her neighbor, which ſhall be better then ſhee.</hi> This is a moſt greeuous puniſhment, whether it be conſidered in it ſelfe, or in the manner of the publiſhing. For he will haue her to be diuorced with ſhame &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and her princely dignitie to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, as being rebellious againſt her king and husband, &amp; another to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted in her place, whereby her greefe might be increaſed with greater indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Neither ought this to ſeeme ſtraunge, when euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of GOD, theſe vices founde place. But theſe things are not to bee meaſured by theyr abuſe, but by the truth and the auncient lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                     <p>5. In the Cittie royall of Suſa, there was a Iewe, whoſe name was Mordecai, the ſon of Iair, the ſonne of Shimei<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſonne of Kiſh, the Beniamite.</p>

               <p>Now is declard what afterwards folowed,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4708:51"/>
and howe it came to paſſe, that the King going about to allaie the want he found of Qu. <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> when by the counſel of his Courtiers, hee had gathered many virgins out of his whole Empire, that out of them he might chuſe one, whome he might take to ſucceed <hi>Vaſhti: Eſter</hi> was preſerred to the Crowne. Afterwarde how <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> by reuealing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie of certaine Courtiers, prepared himſelfe a way to higheſt honours. And this is the ſumme of this Chapter. There are at this preſent two things to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vs: Firſt the counſell which was giuen to the King, to gather togither ſo many Virgines out of his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, out of which hee might chuſe one for his Qu. which beeing approued by the king, is ſtraightwaies executed: which thinges are conteined in the foure firſt verſes. Next, who and of what eſtate <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was, who among the reſt was brought into the kings houſe, where the maidens were gathered together for the King, which is deſcribed from the fifth to the ninth verſe.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of entrance into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, is declared in the I. verſe: to witte,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4708:51"/>
                  <hi>After theſe things, when the wrath of King</hi> Aſſuerus <hi>was appeaſed, he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred</hi> Vaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, <hi>and what ſhe had dose, and what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt her.</hi> The Author maketh not mention what time paſſed from the reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> but it is likely that it was ſome two yeares ſpace: for ſhe was diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about the latter ende of the third yeare of the raigne of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and <hi>Eſter</hi> ſucceeded in her place, in the 7. yeare: ſo there are 4. yeares that paſſed betweene thoſe thinges, of which, if one be allowed to the gathering together of the Virgines, the other in preparing them, according to that which is deſctibed in the 12. verſe, there remine two yeares in which the wrath of king <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> laſted. Now when his wrath was appeaſed, hee remembred the fact of the Queene <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that was made againſt her. Although it bee not expreſly ſaid, that he did repent it, yet may it eaſily be gathered, becauſe it is not without cauſe ſaid, <hi>That his wrath was appeaſed.</hi> For hee might call to minde her beautie, and her noble race deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> hee might acknowledge hee had done her wrong, in that he reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her for ſo light a fault. So then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4708:52"/>
made againſt her, was in the heate of his rage, of which the king beginneth now to repent. This for the moſt part commeth to paſſe in thoſe thinges which are done in a rage: For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are done without aduiſe, they leaue nought behind them but repentance.</p>
               <p>But what is now to be done? there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no remedie, the law is made, yea it cannot bee recalled: and ſo both the cuſtome of the Countrie, and his owne eſtimation, will not permit him to alter any thing in the decree. Wherefore Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and men of high eſtate, who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to anger, which is ſo much the more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, by how much the greater their power is, muſt learne from hence, that they muſt bridle and reſtraine their fury, vnleſſe they will do many things vntuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereby they ſhall incurre great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie, which yet notwithſtanding they cannot by any meanes remedie.</p>
               <p>By this alſo we may marke, that euery paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is aſſwaged and mitigated by time: and reaſon, who was as it were, throwne downe from her throne, receiueth againe her authoritie, but often times too late, when things are brought into ſo bad a

caſe, that there remaineth no remedie. Wherefore, thoſe who contend withper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall hatred, and deadly feende, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie teſtifie, that reaſon is baniſhed out of their mindes, and are more hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords reproofes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſtone againſt the drops, wherwith by often fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The counſell that is giuen by the yong men the Kings ſeruants, is this: <hi>Let there bee ſought for the King, beautiful young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and let the King appoint Officers for this purpoſe, in all the Prouinces of hisking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which ſhall gather all the young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines vnto</hi> Suſa, <hi>the Cittie royall, into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The counſell of young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in weighty affaires, is worthily ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for when as they haue neither wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome nor experience, they do moſt times rather giue that counſell which luſt and paſsion do ſuggeſt, then that which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">1.

Hee is fedde then with hope of enioying thoſe Virgines, who ſhould moſt excell in comelineſſe and beautie, throughout his whole Realmes: he forefaineth vnto himſelfe, all manner of delightes and pleaſures, little caring for publike honeſtie, or the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4708:55"/>
affaires of the Common-wealth. For what earneſt matter can hee thinke of, who toſſeth in his minde none other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to attaine a peece of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act beautie &amp; fauor, paſsing al others in comelineſſe? But of ſuch Gouernours the world is worthie, who onely ſtudie for their owne profite and pleaſure: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all men for the moſt part, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried headlong with immoderate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, preferring tyrannie, before iuſt gouernment. Furthermore, it is little to bee marueiled at, that a Prince ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true religion, did yeelde ſo much to his pleaſures in gathering together ſo many women: When <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>

So then it often commeth to paſſe, that many times Princes haue not the beſt counſell giuen them; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they aske not counſell of the wiſeſt: becauſe they are farre more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4708:55"/>
of ſetting foorth their power and magnificence, then of wiſedome: and more carefull of their pleaſures, then of the common profite. But you will ſay, this counſell was for the good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Church: I confeſſe it, yet is it no whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For God knoweth howe to bring light out of darkeneſſe, though it remaine alwaies darkeneſſe: and hee draweth good forth of euill, the euill ſtill continuing euill.

So great is the goodneſſe &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our God, turning all things to the health and commoditie of his. And thus farre of the counſell and edict, for the gathering of ſo many Virgins into the Kings houſe of women.</p>
               <p>Wee are now to ſee, who and of what eſtate <hi>Eſter</hi> was, which by force of this
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4708:56"/>
decree, was brought to the hande of <hi>Hegai,</hi> the Kings Eunuch, keeper of the women, who were gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the King. <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who by kindred, was her Couſen germain, &amp; had taken her for his daughter, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo afterwardes did direct her with his counſel, for deliuerance of the Church, is deſcribed in two verſes, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Stocke, and of his ſtate. Therefore hee is ſaid to bee <hi>A man of Beniamin, deſcending from</hi> Kiſh, <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Saul, hauing</hi> Iairus <hi>for his father,</hi> Shimei, <hi>his Grand-father, and</hi> Kiſh, <hi>his great Grand-father.</hi> But it is likely, that in this Cenealogie, all the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors of <hi>Mardorhaeus,</hi> vntill <hi>Kiſh,</hi> bee not reckoned. For from the time that <hi>Saul</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Kiſh</hi> began to raigne, vnto the captiuitie, which happened vnder <hi>Iechonia,</hi> there paſſed more then foure hundreth yeares. It is alſo to bee noted, that when theſe thinges came to paſſe, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> was growen to great yeares, for from that captiuitie vnder <hi>Iechonia,</hi> vnto the time which heere is deſcribed, there paſſed foureſcore yeares: ſo that it muſt needes bee, that <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cbans</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:4708:56"/>
was carried with his father <hi>Ianus</hi> into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie. For God doth many times for the good of his Church, giue long life &amp; olde yeares vnto diuers, aboue the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe of nature, as wee read of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iada</hi> the high Prieſt, that hee reached to the age of an hundred and thirtie yeares. In the meane while, wee ſee what for the moſt part is the condition of the children of God in this world, that they bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearſed into diuers parts of the world, and carried captiues into a ſtraunge countrie, neither kings, nor mightie, nor learned men excepted. For there were carried into captiuitie with <hi>Iechonia,</hi> tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande captiues out of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> all being men of might, and all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and cunning men of the kingdome, as appeareth 2. <hi>King.</hi> 24. 14. And this is our comfort &amp; conſolation in flights and baniſhments, that our God doth relieue our exile, by giuing places of abode vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtian Princes, &amp; giueth vs leaue to exerciſe all holy libertie both of body and conſcience vnder their dominion. And ſuch was <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> eſtate.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid afterward that the father of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was the vncle of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> &amp; he is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4708:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
named after in the 15. verſe, <hi>Abihail,</hi> but ſhee remained an Orphane both by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, being borne in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, for otherwiſe ſhee muſt bee of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie foureſcore yeare olde. Shee being in this caſe, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> takes her as his daughter, and doth the dutie of a father towards her: wherein he ſhewes himſelfe to bee a good kinſman and faithful friend of the dead, hauing ſo great care of their daughter left in ſuch a caſe. Her fauour and beautie is commended, becauſe it was the means which got the kings grace, and made a way for her to the royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. So beautie doth helpe thoſe that feare God to obtaine honour, but vnto others it is oftentimes the inſtrument of their deſtruction, as vnto Queene <hi>Vaſhti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe therfore who are more faire then others, haue not whereof to bee proude: but there is rather giuen vnto them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion of humilitie &amp; modeſtie, that they may employ the gifts giuen them by God, to his honour and glorie.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, marke what is the ſtate ſometime of thoſe Virgines which feare God, though borne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and noble Parents. <hi>Eſter</hi> is a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4708:57"/>
a ſtraunger, without father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and poore, whoſe onely treaſure and riches is godlineſſe, and her onely father and defendor the Lord.</p>
               <p>By which example wee are taught, that Parents ought not to bee ſo carefull and greedie for their children, that they do any thing in getting or keeping of wealth for them, which ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their conſcience: when as <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe content with it owne is great riches,</hi> and there can no better enheritance be left by Parents to their children then it.</p>
               <p>Therefore they ought to beſtowe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent care in bringing them vp, &amp; caſt off<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1.</note> all other care, and ouergreat carke of the things that appertaine to this life, and not to carrie with them when they die, that ſorrowe and carefulneſſe which many doo, vnleſſe they haue prouided for their children according to their minde.</p>
               <p>For then are they well prouided for, when they haue God for their father, whoſe bleſsings are on a thouſande generations, towardes them that feare him: ſo that without doubt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4708:58"/>
hee will raiſe vp ſome faithful <hi>Mardochae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who ſhall take care of the children of Gods faithfull ſeruants. Heere alſo all men are taught by the example of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus,</hi> to haue a peculiar care of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, and namely of their kindred and affinitie; and eſpecially of maidens, who for their chaſtitie are in greateſt daunger.<note place="margin">Num. 29. 12.</note> And this carefulneſſe <hi>Iob</hi> proteſteth of himſelfe. Wherefore it is an intollerable ſhame, that ſtonie hearted and more then barbarous men, who abound in riches &amp; wealth, do notwithſtanding ſo little loue and regard euen their owne kindred, that they ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many times to be brought vnto extreame beggerie &amp; penurie. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may they lawfully ſtick at their loſſe, &amp; pretend that for an excuſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> though he were a baniſhed man and a captiue, did not yet caſt off the care of his coſin germane, but brought her vp with him in godlineſſe and religion, the fruites whereof did at the laſt ſhew forth themſelues to the good and profit of the whole Church. Thus haue you what <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was.</p>
               <p>There remaineth now to bee ſet forth, how ſhee was brought into the houſe of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4708:58"/>
women, where the virgins were gathered togither for the King, vnder the hand of <hi>Hegai,</hi> as in the fift &amp; ſixt verſes is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The authour doth not expreſſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were done with <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and hers, or no: it is moſt likely that there was not any ones conſent looked for: and that they ſhould be in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill whoſoeuer ſhould refuſe: but ſeeing they had much profited in godlineſſe, it cannot be doubted but that they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into great diſtreſſe: and that they did wreſtle with many feares: When on the one ſide, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> beholdeth all the good hope hee had of his pupile in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to periſh: and on the other ſide, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> feareth the preſent daunger of being reiected after the King had once known her. For what reaſon ſhould ſhe haue to hope that ſhee ſhould bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the virgines in the whole Empire, and bee exalted into the dignitie royall? Beſides, how do you thinke that ſhee was vexed in mind and conſcience, when ſhe ſaw that ſhee muſt bee ioyned to an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell and vncircumciſed, though a King? and that by this meanes ſhee was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and in a manner rent from the people
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4708:59"/>
of God? Yea, but ſome will ſay, ſhee ſhould rather haue ſuffered any ſhame, &amp; offered her ſelfe vnto a thouſand deaths, then conſent vnto this, to be the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine of an Infidell. But what could ſhee doo? a greater force tooke her away: and peraduenture there was in this fact ſome ſpecial &amp; extraordinarie motion of gods ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, who is wont ſo to leade his through the thickeſt darkneſſe of this world. And if wee ſhould ſay, that in her and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> there were ſome ſparkes of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, we ſhould not ſpeak of any ſtrange and vnvſuall matter euen in the ſaints of God: which yet notwithſtanding we may not imitate. For the infirmities of the ſaints are ſet downe vnto vs in the holy ſcriptures, that wee ſhould wonder at and learne to extoll the goodneſſe of god to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who turneth their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their good; not that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would not therefore ſuffer my ſelf to be perſwaded by any reaſons, much leſſe wold I perſuade any, or yeeld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a chriſtian maiden ſhould be ioyned to the great Turke, though it were in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.

                     <p>10. <hi>Eſter</hi> had not ſhewed her people and her kindred: for <hi>Mordecai</hi> had charged her, that ſhe ſhould not tell it.</p>
                     <p>11. But <hi>Mordecai</hi> walked euery day before the court of the womens houſe, to know if <hi>Eſter</hi> did well, and what ſhould bee done with her.</p>
                     <p>12. And when the courſe of euery maide came to go in vnto King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> after ſhe had been twelue moneths after the manner of women (for ſo were the daies of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification accompliſhed, ſixe moneths with oyle of myrrhe, and ſixe months with ſweet

odours, and in the purifying of women.)</p>
                     <p>13 Then when euery maide came vnto the King, whatſoeuer ſhee required was giuen her, to goe with her out of the womens houſe vnto the kings houſe.</p>
                     <p>14 In the euening ſhee went, and on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhe returned into the ſecond houſe of the women, vnder the hand of <hi>Shaaſhgaz</hi> the Kings Eunuch which kept the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines: ſhee came in to the King no more, vnleſſe ſhe pleaſed the king, and that ſhee were called by name.</p>
                     <p>15 Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the courſe of <hi>Eſter</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Abihail</hi> the vncle of <hi>Mordecai</hi> (which had taken her as his owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) came, that ſhe ſhould go in to the king, ſhee deſired nothing, but what <hi>Hegai</hi> the Kings Eunuch the keeper of the women, ſayde: And <hi>Eſter</hi> found fauor in the ſight of all them that looked vpon her.</p>
                     <p>16 So <hi>Eſter</hi> was taken vnto king <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> into his houſe royall in the tenth moneth, which is the moneth <hi>Tebeth,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth yeare of his raigne.</p>
                     <p>17 And the king loued <hi>Eſter</hi> aboue all the women, and ſhee found grace and fauor in his ſight, more then all the other virgins: So that hee ſet the crown of the kingdome,

But in the holy ſcriptures, many ſuch excellent &amp; memorable examples are propoſed vnto vs, &amp; the meanes dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerued which God did vſe in bringing lowe the one, and lifting vp the other; whereby the order and courſe of<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 40.

Which is moſt euident in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who was exalted to ſo great dignitie in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that hee was next vnto the king: and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who

was brought vp in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and called the ſon of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter: and of <hi>Daniell,</hi> who was ſo great in fauor and autho ritie in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Amongſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whoſe Hiſtorie wee expound, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the laſt place, beeing lifted vp to the crowne royall, from a lowe and baſe eſtate: in which Hiſtorie there is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed by the holy Ghoſt, the meanes which God vſed in exalting her to ſo high an eſtate, for the good of his Church.</p>
               <p>The reiection of <hi>Vaſhti</hi> was as it were the beginning and entrance into it, then the counſell giuen to the king togather togither the faireſt virgines out of all his Empire, was a furtherance of it, though in it ſelfe it were neither good nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; beſides, her beautie and fauour was added, whereby the kings officers were moued to bring her into the houſe of the women vnder the hand of <hi>Hegai:</hi> al which wee haue hitherto declared.</p>
               <p>Nowe there are other meanes ſet downe vnto vs, to wit, that ſhe pleaſed <hi>Hegai,</hi> and vſed wiſedome and diſcretion in her behauiour by the counſell and aduice of <hi>Mardochaeus:</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:4708:62"/>
and that although ſhee were compelled to vſe perfumes: and thoſe other preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed paintings, yet ſhee ſought not any thing whereby ſhee might procure the kings fauour, vnto whom notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhee was moſt acceptable, as alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that ſaw her, inſomuch that by an hidden yet heauenly motion, the Kings loue reſted on her, and hee ſet the royall crowne vpon her head. Thus we ſee how God did lift vp this baſe captiue maiden, and that vſing but ſmall and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes, whereby wee might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learne to acknowledge all to come from his grace and mercie. But wee ſhall knowe theſe things better, by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent expoſition of euery particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>Shee is ſaid to pleaſe</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, <hi>and to finde fauour in his ſight,</hi> neither came that to paſſe as thogh ſhe were the moſt beautifull, moſt noble, moſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, or moſt ſkilfull in courtlike mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but it came of God, who gouerneth and hath in his hand the hearts of men, &amp; turneth them euery way, according to his pleaſure, that hee may procure the loue of all towardes them whom hee will exalt, that is, towardes thoſe that feare
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4708:62"/>
him. So that to purchaſe the good wils of men, wee need no cunning, or wicked, or vnlawfull meanes, as did <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who <hi>did ſteale the hearts of the people:</hi> but<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15 6. 1. Sam. 2. 30.</note> wee muſt feare and honour God, <hi>Who honoreth thoſe of whom hee is honoured:</hi> wee muſt follow the way of integritie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which is the true &amp; only way to get the good wil ofal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto which are altogither contrarie, pride, arrogancie, &amp; inſolencie: Whoſoeuer therefore deſire to bee beloued of others, let them looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, that by it they may learne to bee carefull of vprightneſſe and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The good will of <hi>Hegai</hi> is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an eſpeciall care of his, in yeelding vnto her things fit for women and her portions, that is, giuing vnto her whatſoeuer was requiſite eyther for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell or diet; beſides a traine of ſeuen maids out of the kings houſe, who ſhould attend her, and finally the beſt and moſt commodious place in the houſe of women.</p>
               <p>So the feare of God bringeth all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to the faithful, as the Prophet at large in the 112. <hi>Pſalme</hi> doth particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribe it. Neither is it without cauſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4708:63"/>
that <hi>Dauid</hi> biddeth him that is deſirous<note place="margin">Pſal. 34 12.</note> of long life, and to bee furniſhed plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with al things which are truly good, to fear God, and doo iniurie to no man. Therefore alſo the ſonne of God exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> his to ſeeke the kingdome of heauen and the righteouſneſſe thereof, promiſing that all other things beſides ſhal be caſt vpon them. Yet wee ſay not that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth alwaies bring to thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it, ſuch abundance of honours and goods, but that it is enough if that wee learne by it, to bee content with that meaſure which God doth meaſure vnto euery one, which is more abundant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, then all the ſuperfluities of the wicked.</p>
               <p>The wiſedome and ſilence of <hi>Eſter</hi> are afterward commended vnto vs, to wit, <hi>that ſhee ſhewed neither her people, nor her kindred, as ſhee was commaunded to doo by Mardochaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cauſe of this forbidding is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: but it is not hard to geſſe, that it was done becauſe of that contempt and reproach wherewith the Iewes were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: as well becauſe they were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, as alſo becauſe they followed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4708:63"/>
&amp; contrarie religion from all others. But this inhibition is to be vnderſtoode, to ſtretch ſo farre foorth, vntill ſhee were demaunded by thoſe who had lawful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie ouer her. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vnleſſe ſhe did declare it vnto them when ſhe ſhould be examined, truly ſhe had not only lied, but alſo ſecretly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her religion. It is indeed a high poynt of wiſedome, not raſhly to bewray that which may breede vs hatred, enuie, and contempt: but againe to denie the truth, &amp; to diſſemble what religion we profeſſe when we are demaunded, is a treacherie, which redoundeth to the diſhonour of God. Therfore when the time required it, neither <hi>Eſter</hi> nor <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did hide their religion or their people. Wherefore this place helpeth not thoſe, who by this example would ſhape a defence for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie: for the ſentence of the ſon of God remaineth firm &amp; vnremoued: <hi>Whoſoeuer</hi>

                  </gap>nowne to be a Iewe, and ſhe did abſtain
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4708:64"/>
from meates for bidden in Gods lawe, it ſeemeth that ſhe did ſufficiently bewray her ſelfe. For if any thinke that ſhee did eate of vncleane meates, or violate the Saboth, hee may alſo ſay, that ſhe caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all godlineſſe: foraſmuch as wee ſee, that the faithfull would rather indure any torment, then taſte ſwines fleſh: wherof there is a moſt notable example in the Hiſtorie of the <hi>Macabees.</hi> But I anſwer, that neither the officers who gathered the maides togither, nor <hi>Hegai,</hi> vnder whoſe hand they were kept, enquired ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully after theſe things, but were onely content that ſhee was beautifull, which they chiefly ſought after. I adde, that whereas <hi>Eſter</hi> was in great fauor with <hi>Hegai,</hi> ſhe therefore obtained greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to liue according to the lawe of God, and yet not bee eſpied. So is God wont to watch ouer his, that they runne not into any hatred or contempt, and yet notwithſtanding preſerue their conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſafe. And thus farre of <hi>Eſters</hi> wiſedome. That peculiar care which <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> had alwaies of her, is now after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: <hi>That euery day he walked before the court of the houſe of women, that hee might
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4708:64"/>
learne of</hi> Eſters <hi>proſperitie, &amp; what became of her.</hi> For when as it was not lawfull for him to enter into the womens houſe, he diligently ſought all occaſion to talke with any, by whom he might bee certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning her. Neither was it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe that hee tooke ſo great care for her: for hee knewe that the manners of young maidens eaſily would be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with courtly delights, and ſoone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their former education: as daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth teach, that there is ſcarce one ofan 100. who may chance not to be infected with the vices of the Court, in which hee ſhall be brought vp. For there be fewe <hi>Ioſephs,</hi> few <hi>Moſes,</hi> fewe <hi>Daniels,</hi> who can bee conuerſant in the Courts of Inſidels and Idolaters without ſome ſpot or fault, when as there raigneth ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all manner of corruptions, euen in the Courts of thoſe who profeſſe themſelues to bee Chriſtians. Therefore not without cauſe did <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> ſo fear leaſt <hi>Eſter</hi> ſhould be forgetfull of the doctrine of the lawe, and of that good bringing vp and inſtruction which ſhee had receiued from him. He was careful alſo for her health: and what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4708:65"/>
of her, fearing leaſt if by chaunce her people, and the religion which ſhee did profeſſe ſhould be known, ſhe ſhould be reiected with contempt and reproach, or euill entreated and dealt with. Here all Parents, Tutors and Guardians, by the example of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> are warned &amp; put in minde of their dutie towards thoſe pupils whom God hath committed vnto them, not onely as long as they be vnder their charge, but alſo after they be ſet at libertie: to wit, that they alwaies watch ouer them, and whether they be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued farre off, or be neare vnto them, to helpe forwarde as much as in them lieth, their health and profite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> might ſeeme in his owne conceite, excellently to haue diſcharged his dutie, and might ſaye as many in our time are wont, what ſhould I haue any further care of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſeeing ſhee is ſo well prouided for? I had care of her as long as ſhee was vnder my charge: I haue done what I could for her, I thinke I haue well performed my dutie: ſhee is now in better caſe then I am, why ſhould I trouble my ſelfe any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4708:65"/>
further?</p>
               <p>But true loue is not ſo quenched in the mindes of good kinſmen, it rather raiſeth vp new ſparkles, whereby they may be ſtirred vp to beare an eſpeciall care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to whom they are bound in kindred or alliance; and to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good counſell and aduice.</p>
               <p>But you ſhall ſee in theſe daies, that the greater part of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather ſtudie this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how they may be rid of the charge of their children or pupils, or poore kindred, by what meanes ſoeuer it be; that beeing once freed, they may euer after altogither caſt away that care. And let this ſuffice to be ſpoken of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> care.</p>
               <p>Here is now deſcribed in the three verſes following, the manner of the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, too too labourſome and ſumptuous, and delicate, whereby the maidens were annoynted with oyles and ſweete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, before they were brought vnto the king: Next, in what manner they went in vnto the king: and thirdly, howe they had an other houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for them, after they had bene one night with the king.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:4708:66"/>Theſe are the tokens of extreame rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and extreame wantonneſſe, in this wanton and effeminate Infidell king: wherby we may learne, that thoſe whom the ſpirite of holineſſe and regeneration doth not gouerne, are made the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues of all manner moſt vnſtayed luſts: thinking that all things are lawfull for them by reaſon of their dignitie. This king then beeing a ſeruant vnto luſt, will not touch a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide, though faire &amp; clean, vnleſſe ſhee haue beene firſt whole ſixe moneths beſmeered, and as it were ſoked with oyle of myrrhe, and then other ſixe moneths annoynted, perfumed, and as it were ſeaſoned with all manner of ſweete ſpices. So nothing that is naturall can content theſe vaſſals of moſt prodigious luſts, but onely painting and art doth pleaſe them. Now how troubleſome thinke you was this vnto <hi>Eſter,</hi> who had bene brought vp in all godlineſſe, fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>htie and modeſtie, to be baſted and ſoked a whole yeare in ſuch wantonneſſe and riot? Yea, but ſome will ſay, ought ſhee to endure it? Certes, ſeeing ſhee was a modeſt and godly maiden, I doubt not but ſhee was aſhamed of theſe delicacies
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4708:66"/>
and allurements. But what ſhould ſhee do? whether ſhee would or no, euen with extreame griefe ſhee was compelled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. The vſe indeed of oyles and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes is not ſimply to be condemned, but exceſſe in the vſe of them, and a corrupt affection abuſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an other end then they ought. Neuertheleſſe, in a matter wherein her conſcience was not woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and which ſhe ſought not by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, ſhe might with a good conſcience yeeld to neceſsitie, and frame her ſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the time: keeping notwithſtanding in her heart her former loue of ſimplicitie &amp; puritie, thoſe moſt fit vertues for faithfull virgines. Wherefore theſe things do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing helpe thoſe women, who infected with the poyſon of pride &amp; ambition, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make an ende of painting and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues, that they may turne all mens eyes towardes them, and procure euery ones fauor. Behold yet further here how great the ſlauerie is which they liue in, that liue in the courts of wicked kings. Neither muſt we labor greatly to excuſe <hi>Ester,</hi> as though euery way ſhe were free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all vice. For ſhe might alſo be touched with ſome weakneſſe, euen as wee ſee the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4708:67"/>
moſt holy to haue wreſtled with many infirmities: ſo that in <hi>Eſter,</hi> the mercie &amp; goodneſſe of the Lord doth ſo much the more ſhine, in that he vſed theſe means to procure fauour for <hi>Eſter</hi> with the king. Theſe maidens thus beſmeered and beſmoked, were lead to the King, euery one in her courſe: and there was giuen vnto her whatſoeuer ſhee would deſire, eyther for company or apparrell, when ſhee went in vnto the king: ſo that there was no ſpare made of any thing, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the infatiable luſt of this impure and leacherous king: and it is very likely, that euery maid affecting that high place of royall dignitie, did ſhewe their ſkill in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing of ornaments and faſhions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhee might allure the king to like of her. When they had paſſed the night with the king, they were brought into an other houſe of Concubines, vnder the hand of <hi>Shaaſhgaze,</hi> in which they were holden in perpetuall priſon, vnleſſe the king being delighted in any one of them, did by name call for her.</p>
               <p>There is heere deſcribed vnto vs ſuch an horrible pollution and defiling of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, which we ought moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hate and abhorre: And conſidering
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4708:67"/>
how great the darkneſſe was wherin thoſe miſerable blinde wretches did walke, or rather wander, wee ought to make ſo much the greater account of that light which wee haue receiued from God: and to vſe holy and honourable marriage in moſt holy and pure manner. For if we ſhall do otherwiſe, wee are readie to fall into moſt certaine and vnauoydable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yea though we paſſed <hi>Salomon</hi> in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and we drawe downe vpon vs the iuſt furie of Gods wrath, as he did by the multitude of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; abuſe of holy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie. And theſe things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in theſe 3. verſes, 12, 13, and 14, that we may not ſtay any longer in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the filth of this king who knew not the true God: who yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath at this day too many folowers (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thoſe who profeſſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God) of this his vnchaſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate beaſtlines. Now let vs ſee how <hi>Eſter</hi> behaued her ſelf, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her turn came to go in vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king: &amp; how god got her ſo great fauor with the king, that ſhe was preferred before al the other maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. It is ſaid, <hi>That ſhe dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded nothing, but was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with thoſe things which</hi> Hegai <hi>did preſcribe:</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:4708:68"/>
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this teſtifying that ſhe was drawn againſt her will, and with a diſcontented minde, vnto this impure and vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed king: that ſhe would not go about to purchaſe his fauour by any cunning, but that ſhe gaue ouer her ſelfe wholly to the prouidence and guard of the Lord, that ſhee might be preſerued vndefiled. And this indeede ſhe did obtaine by Gods ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bountie and clemencie, that ſhe was not caſt out into the number of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, but ioyned in lawfull matrimonie to the king. For by how much the more ſhee neglected all painting and beautie gotten by art, by ſo much was ſhee the more accepted and fauoured of all that looked on her: ſo much can Gods fauour, ſo much can modeſtie and ſimplicitie do, in procuring the good will of all men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. Thoſe therefore that feare god, do receiue this reward at his hand, of their vertue and integritie, a reward I ſay and not a gift, but yet of his meer grace and liberalitie, who is debtor vnto none.</p>
               <p>The time when ſhee was brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king is expreſly noted, both that the credite of the Hiſtorie maye bee the greater, and the peculiar care which God

fore we ought not to be ouer curious in ſearching of it: but this is to be obſerued, that Courtiers as they are drawne with deſires and paſsions, do many times very quickly take any occaſion of ſedition and treaſons. For they oftentimes conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Prince, either vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of their petition, or for indignation and hatred, and enuie, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue at other mens honour, whom they cannot abide ſhould be preferred before them, or mooued with ambition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of alteration, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did againſt<note place="margin">2.

Princes alſo themſelues oftentimes by their own inſolencie, pride and crueltie, diuers times by their ſloth and negligence, doo yeelde occaſion to their Courtiers to rebell. Neuertheleſſe, they are wicked and vngodly men, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire wilfully the death of their Prince, and eſpecially thoſe whom hee hath ſo truſted, that they are admitted to the keeping and guard of their perſons: as theſe were by <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> whom hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the cuſtodie of his gate. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch men the way is eaſie to execute
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4708:77"/>
their conſpiracie: as it is reported, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Nobles his moſt familiars, did conſpire the death of <hi>Alexander the great.</hi>

                  <hi rend="margQuotes">But kings are enforced to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues &amp; their life to ſuch men: And look how much the greater the truſt is that is repoſed in them, ſo much the more vgly is their treaſon and deteſtable in the ſight of all men. But vnto ſuch wickedneſſe are we growne in this age, that euen the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, from whom Princes looke for the meanes of their preſeruation, &amp; commit their bodies to their direction, haue bene found to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired the death of thoſe who haue bene the cauſes of their wealth and honor. Wherefore thoſe Princes are bleſſed, who put their truſt wholly in God, and not in mans ayd: thoſe are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie whom God doth ſhield and protect.</hi>

Beſides, in the perſon of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> wee ſee how greatly the life of kings &amp; great men is many times endangered, though their guard do ſeem to defend them againſt all daunger. But often doth it happen, that they are more in daunger then meaner men, eſpecially if they turn their iuſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment into tyrannie. Wherefore the auncients haue vſed it for a prouerb, that

fewe Tyrants deſcend to <hi>Pluto</hi> by drie death, that is, die without bloud. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great, was made away by poyſon: ſo <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was murthered in the Senate: ſo very many Romaine Emperors were ſlaine by their ſouldiers: ſo <hi>Bennadab</hi> was choked: <hi>Isboth</hi> ſlaine by two wicked men on his bed: <hi>Ioas</hi> the king of <hi>Iuda</hi> by two of his ſeruants: <hi>Amaſias</hi> was ſlaine at <hi>Lachis:</hi> finally of twentie kings which raigned in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> tenne of them died by violent death: that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to haue ſpoken vnwittily, who ſaid, that a Tyrant was like to him who ſate at a table furniſhed with all daintie diſhes, accompanied with all kinde of muſicke, and a great many of wayting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men readie at all commaunds; but ſeeing a naked ſword hanging ouer his head by a ſmall thread, and euery minute readie to fall vpon him. Therefore many wiſe men amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue wiſhed that they might reſigne thoſe great honours which they had attained, if ſafely they might, to leade a quiet and ſure life without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as it is written of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar:</hi> Yea, very many haue quite giuen ouer their Empires, as <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

thoſe capitals enemies and perſecutors of Chriſtiaris. <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> when he was to ſet the Diademe on his head, ſaid very fitly &amp; truly: O crown, if men knew how great cares thou brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt with thee, none would ſo much as ſtoupe to take thee vp, though thou layeſt in his way. So that ſtate of life which wee account ſo happie, is oftentimes condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as moſt vnhappie, euen by thoſe who are eſteemed moſt happy, as being moſt ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſo many entrappings, partly of ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies, partly of faithleſſe friendes, from which indeed none could be ſafe, were it not that the eyes of the Lord do watch for the ſafetie of kings, though euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of his fauour &amp; good wil. Which heere wee ſee done for this <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom God raiſed vp <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> by whom hee is in time admoniſhed of the conſpiratours: that no good turne beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed on God, ſhould bee beſtowed in vaine. That benefite which <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> did for <hi>Eſter</hi> and the whole people of God, was very late and freſh in memorie: and god by and by doth requite it, deliuering him from the handes of thoſe who had conſpired his death: that <hi>Dauid</hi> doth not

It is alſo to he noted, that <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> was warned of the treaſon that was practiſed againſt him by the relation of a mean man, that kings may learne to contemne none, though they be but of baſe and low degree. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demaund how <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect that conſpiracie, it may be aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was one of the porters of the kings gate, which is apparant out of this and other places, eſpecially the fift and ſixt chapter, and therfore he might heare and ſee ſomewhat wherby he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the matter: and peraduenture hee might be ſollicited by the traitors, to ſee of what good will he was in the caſe, and to drawe him to their partiallitie. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it was, it pleaſed God to vſe this inſtrument, as well to preſerue the Kings life, as alſo to make knowne <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> fidelitie ſo much the better. We are here then to obſerue, that nothing is done by fortune, but all things are gouerned by Gods prouidence, who by this prepared in time another helper againſt the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

Moreouer, that it is a thing praiſe-worthie to bewray the guiltie, though ſo oftentimes thoſe who detect them incurre great danger, &amp; the hatred of many, eſpecially if vpon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the matter prooue not ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> dealt indeed faithfully and wiſely, but not without daunger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtraunger and a captine: but his oath and office did ſo require.</p>
               <p>He openeth the matter by <hi>Eſter,</hi> either becauſe he thought for his baſeneſſe that hee was not worthie to ſpeake vnto the king, or becauſe hee thought the matter would haue the more authoritie if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a perſon in fauour: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by this meanes the loue of the king towards <hi>Eſter</hi> his wife, might bee encreaſed and confirmed, when he ſhould ſee her ſo carefull of his preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The king alſo handleth the matter wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4708:79"/>
For hee maketh inquiſition, and doth not raſhly vpon a bare report cauſe them to be condemned. By which thing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are warned not to admit vnaduiſedly euery accuſation: for if accuſation onely ſhould ſuffice, who ſhould bee innocent, who ſhould be ſafe from the tongues of ſlaunderers?</p>
               <p>When the matter was found out, the offendors were puniſhed and hanged on a tree, that is, eyther faſtened to a croſſe, as in thoſe times they accuſtomed, or hanged on a galous, as is vſed at this day. Further in the matter of treaſon, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where it concerneth the life of the Prince, the will beeing proued, is holden for the fact: as alſo in other offences, as if any prepare poyſon for anothers death, which yet was not drunke, but giuen to be drunken, ſeeing that hee ſought his life, though hee killed him not, he ſhould die for it.</p>
               <p>Worthely then are theſe two puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by death, though they did but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſpire the kings death: which matter by the kings commaundement is written in the Chronicles of the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:4708:80"/>Heereby it apppeareth, that after a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtome Kings were wont to haue their Chronicles and yearely Acts recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all ages, in which all memorable matters through the whole kingdome ſhould be enrolled, and ſo preſerued for poſteritie. And this is very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe manifold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities which wee receiue by Hiſtories, as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the booke was declared. But the king remembreth not to requite <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus,</hi> in which he cannot eſcape the note of an vnthankfull minde. For as iuſtice hath place in the puniſhing of the wicked for their offences, ſo is it alſo a part of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to reward the good according to their deſerts. But theſe things came not thus to paſſe without Gods prouidence, (which yet excuſeth not <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> fault) that in a more fit time <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> might receiue that honour which was prepared for him by God, as in the ſixt Chapter wee ſhall ſee. Therefore let vs not be wearie of well doing, though the enuie of men encreaſe and ariſe at it, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward though it be deferred, yet ſhall it not be loſt. And if men be vnmindfull of benefits receiued, God, who is rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4708:80"/>
all that call vpon him, and worſhip him in pureneſſe and ſinceritie of mind, will reſtore abundantly, that which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee oweth not: and farther giuing vs the power of wel-willing and wel-working, will crowne his workes in vs with immortall glorie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, be all power and dominion for euer.</p>

               <p>In this Chapter is declared, how <hi>Hama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> indignation was ſo great againſt <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> becauſe hee reuerenced him not, as others did, that hee procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red acommaundement from the king to deſtroy in one certaine day appointed, all the nation of the Iewes which was ſubiect to his Empire.</p>
               <p>At this preſent wee are to conſider, how he was lift vp by the king into ſo high an eſtate of honour, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. How he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced

               <p>See therefore firſt the Authors words, <hi>When theſe things were done, the king</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus <hi>did magnifie</hi> Haman <hi>the ſon of</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medatha <hi>the</hi> Agagite, <hi>and exalted him, ſo that he ſet his ſeate aboue</hi> the ſeate of <hi>all his Prinoes that were about him.</hi> This ſtranger the kings fauor did thus exalt, foure years after the celebration of <hi>Eſters</hi> marriage: for <hi>Eſter</hi> was brought in vnto the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 7. year of the raigne of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> Chap. 2, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. and it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by thoſe things which are ſpoken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Hamans</hi> dignitie and fauour hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the ende of the eleuenth yeare, becauſe aſſoone as hee petceiued that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> would not honour him, hee conſpired the death of him and all his nation, about the beginning of the 12. yeare of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> raigne, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. The cauſe is not expreſſed why hee was thus promoted by the king, neither ought wee
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4708:82"/>
greatly to labour in ſearching it: for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes kings for very light cauſes doo exalt men altogither vnworthie, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe men that deſerue honour, and that are endued with excellent vertues: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they perſwade themſelues, that their will ought to ſtand for reaſon, and that whatſoeuer they liſt, is lawfull for them. Oftentimes for a litle ſeruice euen in an vnhoneſt matter, for counſell giuen to eſtabliſh tyrannie, and augment tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, for inuenting ſome new delight and pleaſure, for ſome extreame flatterie; and ſuch like, kings perſwade themſelues that they haue ſufficient cauſe to promote the worſt men to the higheſt honours, and to admit them into the number of their chiefeſt friends, and to follow their aduiſe and counſell in their moſt weightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. For what cauſe then ſo euer <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was promoted, it appeareth hee was a man vnworthie of it, beeing full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and crueltie: and ſo it often commeth to paſſe, that wicked men by their crafts and cunning, are preferred by the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate fauour of Princes, to honour, and yet not without Gods prouidence, who onely lifteth vp whom pleaſe him, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4708:83"/>
throweth down whom he liſt. Now God doth this as well to exerciſe the godly, as to puniſh the vnthankfulneſſe of the world, to beate downe the pride of kings who abuſe their power, and to throwe downe the vngodly, with ſo much the greater ſhame and ruine, by how much the higher they were exalted. That ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which the king commaundeth to bee giuen to him, offendeth in exceſſe: becauſe it was more then beſeemeth man, though vſual to be yeelded to the kings of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But this is altogither a wonderfull matter, how kings being ſo carefull and iealous ouer their honor, do yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding communicate it euen vnto bad men, in whom there ſhineth not the leaſt ſparkle of vertue. For it is moſt worthie and commendable and profitable for the ſtate, to preferre to the gouernment of the Common-wealth, men notable for their vertues and wiſedome. So <hi>Pharao</hi> made <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ruler of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whoſe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was ſufficiently knowne and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> by his wiſedome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained great honor both with <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar;</hi> &amp; with <hi>Darius.</hi> Notwithſtanding many times Princes are too prodigall in

theſe things, ſuppoſing that they, imitate the magnificence of God, in promoting to honour whom pleaſe them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this <hi>Haman</hi> is ſaid to be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagite,</hi> that is, of the ofſpring of the kings of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who all were of <hi>Agag,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Agags,</hi> as the kings of <hi>Eegypt</hi> were all called <hi>Pharaoes</hi> of <hi>Pharaos;</hi> and the Emperours of <hi>Rome, Caeſars</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi>

ſhip was mingled therewith. Seeing that heere therefore the queſtion was of an honour, more then ciuill and due vnto a man, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> refuſeth to fall downe on his face, &amp; indeed ſo much the rather, becauſe this <hi>Haman</hi> was deſcended from a Nation which God had curſed, and which he willed his people ſhuld hate and abhorre.</p>
               <p>Now his conſtancie is ſo much the more to bee commended, that looke how much the more he is vrged at, and carped by the Courtiers, to obey the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo much the firmer is he in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and is daunted by no threatnings, neither being accuſed to <hi>Haman,</hi> eyther concealeth his Nation, or diſſembleth his religion, which was the onely cauſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not caſt down himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, whom he knew by Gods decree (which could not be called backe) to bee accurſed. The greater then that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie was of the Courtiers, who flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>Haman</hi> and ſought his fauour; the more greeuous the threatnings were; the more certaine the daunger that hanged o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> head; the more praiſe worthy was his vertue and conſtancie.

And without all doubt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the queſtion is of the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of life, a faithfull man ought to be certainly perſwaded, that hee neither doth nor taketh in hand any thing, but by the immooueable authoritie of the word of God, to whom he dedicateth his life, and committeth the iſſue of all euents vnto him.</p>
               <p>Now by how much the more firme that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> conſtancie is, by ſo much the more is the rage of <hi>Hamans</hi> wrath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For the proude can beare nothing

with leſſe patience, then to be deſpiſed by good men, eſpecially if they be but fewe in number, and of ſmall abilitie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. His anger ſeemeth vnto him to be iuſt and right, ſeeing that he is ſupported by the fauour of the King, the obedience of the Courtiers, and the moſt willing conſent of all others: and that onely this wretch, a ſtrange Iew, and a captiue too, doth reſiſt him.

               <p>Heere alſo is to be obſerued, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and patience of God, who though he had many yeares before giuen ſentence of the rooting out of the Amalekites, yet deferred the firſt execution of it about 4. hundred yeares after hee had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; and from that time there paſſed

fiue hundred yeares and moe, to this wherein he ſuffered <hi>Haman</hi> to be exalted to ſo high a degree of honour. But wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are appeaſed with no benefites from the Lord; nay rather they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed more and more in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. For GOD had hitherto ſuffered <hi>Haman</hi> with long patience, but hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth how vtterly to ouerthrowe the church.

               <p>AFter that wicked men haue once conceiued miſchief, they alwaies are in trauell of it, vntill they haue brought it foorth: ſo that they ceaſe not, vntill they haue cruelly put in execution that which wickedly they did deuiſe: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the deſire of reuenge doth pricke them on.

               <p>This is clearely to be ſeene in this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Haman,</hi> who when vpon that furious indignation which he had conceiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> would not honor him, he had determined with himſelfe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to kill him, but togither with him, to deſtroy the whole nation of the Iewes: hee burneth with deſire ſpeedily to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that his bloodie purpoſe, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth carefully alwaies to perfect it: and

But the eye of the Lord, which watcheth for the ſafetie of his, cauſeth that thoſe wicked ones, do often bring forth a birth, quite contrary to their deliberation, and that they fal into the pit which they digged for others: and into the nets which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues did bend, and that the euill which they went about, falleth vpon their own head.</p>

all which things, by the expoſition of euery part, we ſhal the better vnderſtand.

vnto Lots, to aſk counſel of his gods, and to enquire whether that were acceptable vnto them which he went about, &amp; what opportunitie they would yeelde him for the performance thereof. For there is nothing ſo vniuſt which idolaters do not perſwade themſelues to be acceptable to their gods, when as it once liketh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>What kinde of lotte hee vſed no man knoweth, becauſe the holy Scriptures do not declare.

deuiſe, So the father of lyes, after he had turned men away from the word of God, and thoſe anſweres which hee gaue by his true ſeruants and Prophets, which are the only rule according to which our life and all our actions are to be framed, he did eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make them madde with ſo many ſorceries and diuinations, which he brought in, in ſteed of Gods word, and bewitched them by all meanes, with diuers ſorts of lyes in ſteed of Gods truth: that if at any time he ſpake any thing that were true, and that things came to paſſe as he foretold them, it was done by Gods iudgement, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the vncleane ſpirit the efficacie of error, and granting him libertie, that thoſe who had left the loue of the truth might<note place="margin">2.

So Satan by reaſon of that great knowledge and experience hee hath of things paſt, might a great wayes before, by the cauſes gather the effects, and by certain co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures foretel of things to come: which is not to diuine, but by the cauſes to iudge of the effects, which all men are wont to doo, who haue attained to any perfect knowledge of any ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing this peſtiferous vanitie

Let no man therefore thinke the ſinne of Diuiners, Sorcerers, Enchanters, Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers, and thoſe who vſe familiar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to be a light ſinne: for they all leaue God to followe the diuel: and the light that ſhineth in the holy ſcriptures, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in lies; and for Chriſt their Maiſter, they follow <hi>Beliall:</hi> &amp; in ſtead of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light of his ſpirit, they run after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deceits of the ſpirit of darknes. It is further to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that there be many ſorts of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts &amp; diuinations which proceed from the wicked ſpirit, which yet vnskilful men accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be but ſports &amp; paſtimes, or elſe things lawful to be vſed: as, to knit a point to hinder the effect of holy matrimony; to moue a ſiue; to know who hath taken or ſtolne any thing; to throw the key of the chief doore of the houſe into the fire, that the witch may come, who is ſuſpected to haue bewitched any: to run to ſoothſaiers or diuiners, either to recouer things loſt, or to get helpe for any diſeaſe, or to know whether a diſeaſe be deadly, or to heare

foretelling of good fortune by them: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally out of dreames or the meetings of any thing to ſearch out the trueth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to come. For Sathan cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingling himſelfe in all theſe things doth guide them: that he may turne away the minds of men from the word of God, from his feare, from truſt in his fatherly goodneſſe, and finally from care &amp; heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, to learn of the ſpirit of God the way whereby we may be gouerned in all diſtreſſe, calling vpon him, and attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reading and hearing his word. For that malicious ſpirit leaueth nothing vnatte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſearcheth all crafts, wherby when hee hath turned vs from the onely voyce &amp; doctrine of our good ſhepheard Chriſt Ieſus, hee may leade vs after himſelfe, to ſeeke counſell, ayde and helpe at his hand. But thoſe that turne away from Chriſt Ieſus to theſe vaine and idolatrous things, muſt looke for nothing elſe but ruine and confuſion. For what other thing can hee bring vnto man, who was a liar &amp; a murtherer from the beginning,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> but onely death and deceit? Now heere by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way we may note, the means which they followed, who were the chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4708:94"/>
of that ſlaughter and horrible but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the poore faithful ones in <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> euen they vſed the art and counſell of Witches, Soothſayers, and wicked ſpirits, as there are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yea and in the Courts of Princes many, very diuels incarnate, who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted altogither to thoſe deceits, and to all kinde of magicall incantations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinations.

And what other thing is that but a kinde of Necromancie? Therefore what maruell is it, that a religion founded vpon lies, is maintained by the ſame arts, and giueth place to the crafts and deceites of Sathan to oppreſſe the Church of God? And this was the firſt way which <hi>Haman</hi> vſed for the executing of his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee by what skill he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the king, that hee might abuſe his name and authoritie to effect his cruell purpoſes. Haman <hi>ſaide to the king</hi> Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>there is a people diſpearſed among thy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4708:95"/>
people in all the Prouinces of thy kingdom, yet ſeparated from others, whoſe lawes are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from the lawes of all people: and the kings lawes they do not obſerue, and therefore it is not profitable for the king to ſuffer them.</hi> Hee diſdaineth to name the Iewes, but that hee might make them odious to the king, hee ſetteth them foorth by theſe foure notes. 1. That they are diſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all the kings Prouinces.</p>
               <p>2. That they dwell apart from others.</p>
               <p>3. That they haue lawes different from all other people. 4. That they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the kings lawes: that is ſhortly, that they are a people ſingular, eſteeming no lawes but their owne: and therefore ſetting light by the kings lawes, they are alwaies readie to rebell, and ſo much the more to be feared, that being mingled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where among the kings ſubiects in all his Prouinces, they are a bad example for the reſt to ſtir vp any ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The laſt poynot of this accuſation is moſt falſe, and other things alſo are brought to ſet a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to deceiue the king, and to make them ſuſpected of rebellion. Hee obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their calamity as a reproach, that they were diſpearſed into ſundrie Prouinces,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4708:95"/>
as though this had bene done of purpoſe, and certaine aduiſe by them, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the violence of thoſe by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were lead into captiuitie, &amp; ſo diſpearſed, according to thoſe threatnings which many ages before, god had threatned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, if they rebelled againſt him and his lawes by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and other Prophets. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. That which hee telleth that they are ſeuered from the lawes of al peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reſpecteth their religion, whereby God had diſtinguiſhed them from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people, and did preſcribe vnto them holy and diuine lawes, that they might ſerue him according vnto his will. For as touching the lawes ciuill and ſtatutes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticque, they could vſe none other but the kings, vnleſſe they were permitted by the king, to liue according to their owne manners and cuſtomes. So that hee reprooueth and accuſeth them of that whereof they did moſt glorie before God, and which they eſteemed as their greateſt praiſe, that they were ſegregated by God, as his proper treaſure and ſtore: that they might bee his holy nation, a people ſet at libertie, and parte of his inheritance: and that he had giuen
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4708:96"/>
them from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt holy lawes, which ſhould be their wiſedome, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith. For the lawes of other people concerning religion, were meer folly and abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, for their idolatrie and impietie. But ſo vſe the blinde and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to obiect vnto the people of God as a fault, their holineſſe, their beautie, and finally the heauenly doctrine which they haue from God. Laſt of all hee accuſeth them as diſobedient to the kings lawes, which was moſt falſe, vnleſſe peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maliciouſly hee impute the priuate fact of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> to the whole nation, and that in a thing ſo iuſt, to wit, that he gaue not the honor due vnto the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall God alone, to a mortall creature. By this accuſation it appeareth, that the Iews though they were captiues, had nothing to do with the idolatrie of the Gentiles, but obſerued their ſacred ceremonies, as circumciſion, the Sabboths, choiſe of meates, and of other cleane things which were commanded by the lawe of God.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemeth that this was granted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or at the leaſt ſuffered by the kings, who therein were more fauourable vnto their poore ſubiects, then the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous

kings of our age, who cannot by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes abide thoſe that profeſſe true godlineſſe. For who knoweth not but that the enemies of the Church, doo vſe the ſame ſpeeches with <hi>Haman,</hi> and are carried away by the ſame ſpirit? For if the faithfull endeuour to depend vpon the voyce alone of the ſon of God, which is the Goſpell, are they not by and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſingularitie, ſedition, contempt, obſtinacie, ſaucineſſe, and ſelfe conceit? Are they not accuſed as contemners of lawes, and the conſtitutions of all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, of the Councels, Fathers, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they haue lifted vp aboue the ſeate of Chriſt: and finally as rebelles againſt kings and their lawes and ſtatutes? But I pray you, wherefore? Forſooth becauſe they refuſe to worſhip that Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſerue his Idoles, and to preferre his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions before the commandements of Chriſt Ieſus as they do. So wee ſee the malice and wickedneſſe of <hi>Haman</hi> and his bloudie mind, as yet to remaine in the mouthes and hearts of the capitall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church.</p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding, let vs giue

exceeding great thankes to our good and gracious God, who at the laſt made it manifeſt, that the king had none more ſtubborne and diſobedient and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then thoſe who accuſed the Church of rebellion. For how commeth it to paſſe, that at this day the Leaguers riſe ſo rebelliouſly againſt the king, but that they are bewitched with the falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Pope? Do they not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewe, that they haue onely hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to abuſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings name, that they might wrongfully accuſe vs? Is it not abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experienced that they cared not for the king edicts, but ſo farre foorth as they abuſed them to oppreſſe vs? Nay, what Edicts haue not theſe good Catholickes deſpiſed, but thoſe which haue bene wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from the king to deſtroy religion?</p>
               <p>Now that which they blame vs for, that wee will not bee preſent in their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall aſſemblies and Churches, and obſerue the ſame ceremonies and rites with them, is it not rather contrariwiſe a moſt high praiſe vnto vs, that we will not come into any fellowſhip with thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and idolatrous rites wherwith their Churches are ſtuffed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </hi> inferreth, that they ſhall bee deſtroyed with a generall maſſacre. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies more moderate, wherby thoſe who obey not good lawes as they ſhuld, may bee corrected and amended, which are to be followed, rather then at once to deſtroy them all. In that he ſaith, <hi>It is not profitable for the king,</hi> he hath reſpect vnto that common ſpeech, that but one kind of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only is to be ſuffered in one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the diuerſitie of religion is the cauſe of ſedition and war, that the people which liue after their own faſhion, will eaſily rebel and reuolt vnto the enemies of the kingdome.</p>

Indeed falſe religions doo eaſily beare one an other, but all hate the true: for truth and lying cannot ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4708:98"/>
Faith, one Lawe. And indeed it is a moſt excellent ſaying ſo that it be well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: but when error is placed in ſteed of faith, and abuſe for law, and a tyrant for a King, that vnion and vnitie which is ſo much deſired, is turned into a miſerable deſtruction &amp; ſcattering of true doctrine. Furthermore, that ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ſo far of from being true, that it is hurtfull and damage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to kings, to ſuffer in their Kingdoms Gods people profeſſing pure doctrine, that on the contrary, it is moſt profitable, and their preſeruation dependeth vpon it. For God doth preſerue the world for his elects ſake, although wicked men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues, that the faithfull are the cauſe of all calamities and euill. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that which <hi>Haman</hi> thought was not profitable for King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> was the commoditie and glory, yea and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and defence of his Kingdome. For did not <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> diſcloſe that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie which was made againſt the king, and by his wiſedome preſerued him from it?</p>
               <p>And therefore ſo much the more is the concluſion of <hi>Haman</hi> to be condemned, that the whole Nation of the Iewes was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4708:99"/>
to be deſtroyed: and ſo much the more his froward malice to be abhorred, that perceiuing his requeſt to bevniuſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth tenne thouſand tallents of ſiluer, whereby the loſſe might bee ſupplied, which it ſeemed the King ſhould ſuſtaine by the ſlaughter of the Iewes. So that he ſufficiently ſawe his purpoſe was voyd of all humanitie, &amp; damageable to the kings reuenues, and therefore he promiſeth to recompence that loſſe with the ſum of 10000 tallents of ſiluer. And by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it appeareth how thirſtie he was of the bloud of theſe wretched men, when he endeuoureth to buye it, hee careth not with what ſum: and goeth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the King in faigning himſelfe to be moſt carefull of his profit, in as much as he ſticketh not to beſtowe ſo great a ſum, from which there ſhall ariſe a double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the King, both by making away that ſtubborne and rebellious people, and by encreaſing the Kings treaſure by ſuch an heape of ſiluer: in ſuch ſort do the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked account nothing ſo deare or pretious, which they will not willingly beſtowe on the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church. Some there are that thinke that <hi>Haman</hi> did not offer
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4708:99"/>
this ſumme of his own, but of the ſpoyles of the Iewes: and that he was not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, that he would buye their bloud at ſo deare a price, whome hee eſteemed no better then dogs; as for the moſt part, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters are wont to ſet light by the bloud of the faithfull: but by the comparing of this place, with thoſe things which are after ſpoken in the 13. verſe, of taking the ſpoyle of the Iewes, and with thoſe things which are ſet downe in the 7. verſe of the next Chapter, that <hi>Haman</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pay that ſumme of ſiluer into the Kings treaſure, for the Iewes, to deſtroy them, it appeareth ſufficiently, that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this ſum of his owne. For otherwiſe to what purpoſe ſhuld a ſubiect offer ſuch a ſum vnto his King, of the ſpoyle of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: Therfore althogh the enemies of the Church be exceeding couetous, yet the deſire of reuenge, and that deadly hatred wherewith they are driuen, doo compell them to any prodigalitie, ſo that they may ſhead the bloud of the faithfull at theyr pleaſures. This is apparant in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Cleargie, whoſe inſatiable coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe is knowne vnto euery man; yet they ſpare not any coſt, to ſolicite
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4708:100"/>
Kings, and ſet them on to the ſlaughter of the godly: buying their bloud with the greateſt &amp; moſt pretious part of their Eccleſiaſtiall reuenues. And the people alſo being bewitched with the importune cryes of falſe teachers and Ieſuites, do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſpend part of their goods, ſo that religion may vtterly be aboliſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: with ſuch and ſo great hatred, which by no meanes can bee appeaſed, doth the world fight againſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and his truth: ſo <hi>Satan</hi> ſpeweth out his rage and venome againſt the Church, by his miniſters: and ſo is the bloud of the faithfull ſolde for ready mony. But God forbid that we ſhuld grudge at this, when we know that Chriſt Ieſus our Lord was ſo betrayed, and ſold for a certaine ſum of mony. And this is <hi>Hamans</hi> opinion for the deſtruction of the nation of the Iewes. Let vs then go forward to the kings anſwer, in which his exceeding great inabilitie and vnskilfulneſſe is ſeen: for without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, <hi>taking his Ring from his finger, he gaue it to</hi> Haman <hi>the ſon of</hi> Hammedatha, <hi>the Agagite, that wold oppreſſe the Iewes:</hi> &amp; beſides, <hi>he ſaid</hi> to <hi>Hama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he giueth him all that ſiluer, &amp; beſides that people alſo, to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4708:100"/>
do with them as ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi> The ring is giuen him in ſign of the authoritie &amp; power which he receiued of the King, to vſe as ſhuld ſeeme good vnto him. And this further appeareth, in that hee giueth him the mony offered, &amp; permitteth him to vſe his pleaſure with the people. So we<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 42.</note> ſee, that <hi>Pharao</hi> but in a lawfull cauſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wold giue abſolute authoritie vnto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in his Kingdome, to diſpoſe all things as he pleaſed, gaue vnto him his Ring. But what ſhal we moſt wonder at in this bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh king? whether that hee gaue ouer his power to an other, and him a ſtranger, or that ſo raſhly he admitteth his accuſation? or that ſo cruelly he condemnethſo many innocents, and gaue their goods for a pray? or that without any mans aduiſe not hearing the accuſed, neither making any inquiſition of the cauſe, hee deliuereth ouer ſo headdily ſo many thouſand men, to ſo bloudie a ſlaughter?</p>
               <p>Kings ought to bee a liuing lawe, a ſanctuary for the afflicted, a helpe to the oppreſſed, the Image of God on earth, and a defence and comfort of the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and thoſe in calamitie.</p>
               <p>What then will come to paſſe, when
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4708:101"/>
Kings giue eare onely to falſe accuſers, haue vnmercifull eyes, inhumane hearts, mindes without reaſon, iudgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out equitie or right? Are they not then rather the enemies of mankind, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of lawe, the ſuberſion of iuſtice, the ſupporters of the wicked, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of iniuſtice, and the vtter deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all good? Such an one here <hi>Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rut</hi> ſhewes himſelfe to be, not only voyd of all iuſtice, reaſon and equitie: but alſo of all common ſence and humanitie. But ſo for the moſt part it commeth to paſſe in the affaires of the Church, ſo there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that will accuſe, the eares of Princes are open to any accuſation: if the queſtion be of the vtter deſtruction of it, it ſhall be decreed: but in other things, in the leaſt trifles, euen in the death of dogges, there will bee ſome ſticking at the matter: but the people of God with the Princes of this world, are no more eſteemed then the ofſcouring and refuſe of the whole world. But why ſhould we maruel at this, when <hi>Barrabas</hi> was preferred before our Lord and Sauiour?</p>
               <p>Againſt theeues there is obſerued a due courſe of law, neither are the guiltie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4708:101"/>
their cauſe not beeing heard. Many times the ſeditious and rebellious multitude are ſpared by reaſon of their great number: and becauſe that euen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature abhotred the ſlaughter of ſo many, yea though they haue deſerued it: yea, and the moſt raging enemies after the heate of the battell, are wont to ſpare thoſe whom they haue ouercome, though they were iniured by them: but this vnmanlike king in the midſt of peace, not being iniured, no man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining but one priuate ſlaunderer, doth deliuer ouer a whole nation, to the number of ſome two or three hundred thouſand perſons, to a bloudy death and butchery. How truly was it ſaid, that the tongue of the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer is worſe then Serpents, then the poyſon of Aſpes, ſharper then any two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſword, and more deadly then the biting of any the moſt ſauage beaſt? And that kings voyde of counſel &amp; wiſedome, are the plague and ruine of manking? It is alſo a matter of great mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the whole ſtate, what maner of friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours Princes haue: for if they be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, there can none other thing bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for from them, but euill counſell, to the damage of the ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:4708:102"/>Wherefore thoſe people are indeed wiſe, who by their lawes preſcribe vnto their Princes, a certaine number of wiſe men for their counſell: but ambition and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie cannot long beare any good and ſtayed counſell.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, heere-hence wee perceiue, out of what fountaine the moſt bloudie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the Church doo ſpring, to wit, partly from the malice of certaine wicked counſellors, who breathe out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but blood and fire, and partly from the inabilitie or rather blockiſhneſſe of Kings, who making no enquirie of the the trueth, deliuer ouer Gods people to their bloodie butcherie. Such is the ſtate and condition of the Church vnder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull kings, <hi rend="margQuotes">&amp; namely thoſe who giue eare vnto euill Counſellors.</hi> So haue our miſerable Churches in <hi>France,</hi> bene ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Hence therefore let vs learne, not to truſt in any earthly Prince, but in God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who ſo oft hath deliuered vs from the furie of ſo many moſt cruell enemies:

So for the moſt part we ſee it to come to paſſe, that thoſe who are placed in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, for the defence of good men, the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of lawes, and preſeruation of publique peace, do often times (kings being caried away with euil counſellours) beſtow their labour in murthering and maſſacring the moſt quiet &amp; peaceable ſubiects, making no enquirie before whether it bee done by right or wrong, to whom it is inough to ſay: Thus it was the Kings pleaſure: neither are they mindful that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that place not to ſerue the Princes luſt, who as other men, is mortall; but to ſerue the lawes, and render to euery one that which is theirs. Wherfore that ſaying<note place="margin">Traiane.</note> of an Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> is greatly to bee prayſed, who deliuering vnto the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of his horſemen the ſword into his hand, ſpake vnto him theſe words: Vſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4708:105"/>
this for mee, if I commaund that which is right: and againſt me, if I command that which is vniuſt. But the tyrannous will, or rather luſt of many Princes, challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth the force of lawe, and to be the rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, although euen in ieſt they delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of moſt vniuſt matters.</p>
               <p>The Scribes againe on the other part, yeeld themſelues moſt obedient to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and obiect nothing againſt ſo bloudy and violent an Edict: they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth diſpleaſe the King. Nothing alſo in ſo cruell a proclamation ſeemeth vniuſt or vnlawfull to the Nobles and Captains, but they are ready to fulfill it. So in our age, if Edicts were to bee penned againſt religion, the Scribes could neuer ſatiſfie themſelues in deuiſing ſignificant words, to make them more haynous and cruell: the Gouernours without any exception, were ready with all their might ſeuerely to obſerue them: and the people receiued them with alioy and gladnes. And as here al things were written in the kings name, and ſealed with the Kings ſeale: ſo in our age, the colleagued enemies of the church and true religion, with great cries and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth, pretended ſtill the kings name

and maieſtie, and haue vſed his forces and the common treaſure to the oppreſsing thereof: running as it were to quench a fire that would bring deſtruction to the whole Realm. Lo then how this Edict was written in authenticall forme, according to <hi>Hamans</hi> will and luſt.</p>
               <p>Let vs come now to thoſe things that were contained therein, for of the maner how it came and was diſpearſed into the Prouinces, we will ſpeake after in the 15. verſe. The Proclamation containeth two principall poynts.</p>
               <p>The former is, the killing of all Iewes, without ſparing or making difference, and that all togither vpon one appointed day; and the ſpoyling of their goods as a pray.</p>
               <p>The other, that this decree be made knowne vnto all Prouinces, that all men might be ready againſt the day prefixed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſo bloudy aſlaughter. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former: <hi>Haman</hi> is not contented with the common worde of killing the Iewes, but that he might the better lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4708:106"/>
not any place be left for manhood or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, wherewith mooued men at leaſt migh ſpare infants, he maketh mention of euery one ſeuerally as well <hi>young as olde; little children as women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This butcherie is appointed vpon one and the ſame day, that with greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he might wallowe in aboundance of bloud, flowing from al places at one time: and that the cut-throates in euery place might the more bee ſtirred vp vnto that horrible ſlaughter: nay farther, that they may not ſpare any, the goods of thoſe that are ſlaine, are ſet open for a pray to bee ſpoyled, that euery one hauing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed, might runne vnto that ſlaughter, with a barbarous and vnbridled furie.</p>
               <p>If any man demaund with what ſhew of reaſon ſo deteſtable a fact could bee ſhadowed, the anſwere is eaſie, vpon <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> accuſation they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as contemners of the Kings lawes, and religion.</p>
               <p>Finally, the hatred of God and of true religion, was a ſufficient incitement vnto them to commit ſo beſtiall a maſſacre. Paraduenture it may ſeeme ſtrange and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4708:107"/>
incredible that ſo bloudie a decree could bee made, when the moſt enraged ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and moſt bloudie, are wont in warres to ſpare women &amp; children, vnleſſe euen in our owne age we had ſeene farre more cruell things then theſe: not onely to haue bene deliberated of, and decreed by thoſe who brag that they are Chriſtians, but alſo to haue beene executed with ſo great and ſo barbarous rage by them, that euen a mans heart will quake onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it. For if any man call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that arreſt of Parliament made at <hi>Aix</hi> againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Cabriers,</hi> and <hi>Merindoll,</hi> about ſome 44. yeares ago; and alſo that moſt horrible butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie begunne at <hi>Paris</hi> the 24. of Auguſt, 1572. and afterward ſpread into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities of <hi>France,</hi> he muſt needes bee driuen to confeſſe, that theſe were ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell that they paſſed all others, and this laſt ſo barbarous that it turneth away mens eyes from all others, vnto that alone: the crueltie was ſo fierce and vnheard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that none can ſufficiently wonder at it, and bee mooued with horror, who haue but onely heard the report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>

               <p>But by whom (I beſeech you conſider) were thoſe horrible &amp; ſauage ſlaughters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>For this purpoſe not many yeares paſt was that League made among the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours, who aſſembled themſelues, and bound themſelues by oath, to oppreſſe, ſpoyle and deſtroy the reſt of the Church, not onely in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> but in all places of the world, where the name of Chriſt Iesus is purely called on, and his Goſpell ſincerelytaught.</p>

               <p>The other point is, that <hi>the contents of this writing, ſhould be made knowne to all People and Prouinces, that they might all bee prepared againſt that day,</hi> that is, that the cut-throates in all coaſtes ſhould be ready to ſet vpon the Iewes and to kill them.</p>

               <p>But what a confuſion is that, and what diſturbing of order, ſo to allure, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome the people to ſlaughter?

The king vrgeth this matter, as though it concerned his Crowne, or the defence of the State of the whole Empire, as though the enemies were at the gates. So it commeth to paſſe, that the miſchieſe begun by the wicked againſt the Church, encreaſeth as it goeth: and the wicked wil of vngodly men, alwaies runneth into the woorſt, ſo that they neuer giue reſt ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themſelues nor others, vntill they haue brought their vngracious purpoſe to an end.</p>
               <p>This vnwiſe King, is not aſhamed to publiſh euery where his iniuſtice, &amp; more then barbarous crueltie, and to ſolicite his ſubiects to accompliſh it: he little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the iudgement of poſteritie againſt him, neither careth what may followea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his ſubiects, of ſo inhumane a fact: ſo much can the words of thoſe preuaile, who daily perſwade Kings to new ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

And this is a horrible ſenceleſneſſe, wherewith Satan hath blinded them in the middeſt of their malice, that they ſhould not feele it or be diſpleaſed with themſelues for it, which were a beginning of health and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

               <p>WE haue heard how great a perill and deſtruction was prepared for the Iewes, that were diſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all the Prouinces of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Empire, as well by the malice of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> as by the negligence and iniuſtice of the King, yet not without Gods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and iuſt decree, who ſo would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his, that his power might ſhine in their weakeneſſe; his glory in their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance; and his iuſtice in reuenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his and their enemies: which things wee ſhall bee taught in the foure Chapters which followe in this holy Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter is ſhewed to what remedies <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> had recourſe, that he might be deliuered from theſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: to wit, to God firſt, in faſting and prayer: and then to the King by the interceſsion of <hi>Eſter,</hi> vnto which ſhee giueth not her aſſent without ſome ſtay.</p>
               <p>This doctrine is very neceſſarie for vs, that we may know both in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and priuate calamities whatſoeuer that growe vnto vs, by what meanes they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4708:115"/>
may be ouercome: to wit, that after the example of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> and the reſt of the whole people of the Iewes, we hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly flee vnto the grace and mercie of God: then, if any way be opened vnto vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our innocencie may be made knowne, and the hearts of the oppreſſors turned, by the meanes of thoſe who are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and fauour, that wee wiſely follow it, placing neuertheleſſe our whole hope in the Lord. Now then let vs ſee how <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> behaued himſelfe in both theſe meanes, not onely hauing care and regard of himſelfe, but alſo of his whole Nation, that it might be deliuered from that blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die butcherie.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore it is ſet downe, <hi>that</hi> Mardochaeus <hi>when he knew what was done, rent his clothes, and couered himſelfe with ſackcloth and aſhes, and went through the Citie, crying out with a great crie and a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Whereunto let vs ioyne, that which was done by the reſt of the Iewes, who heard the decree, <hi>That there was great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faſting and weeping, and mourning, and many lay in ſackcloth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,</hi> as in the third verſe is ſaid. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence it appeareth, that the Edict was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4708:115"/>
not ſo ſecret among a fewe, but that at the leaſt it was ſo ſpread abroade, that the Iewes were certified thereof, yea and had a copie of it.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth very likely, that it was not yet openly proclaimed, ſeeing that neither <hi>Eſter,</hi> nor thoſe who attended her, knew any thing thereof, as is eaſily gathered out of the fourth and fift verſes. Beſides it is gathered by that, that ſeeing the decrees of the Perſians were irreuocable, there could not but great confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ariſe throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Empire, by the decree gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Iewes to defend themſelues: when others alſo had commaundement to inuade and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer was done, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> had intelligence of the whole matter, and alſo the Iewes in the Prouinces, God by his ſecret prouidence ſtirring vp his, that perceiuing ſo great a daunger decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they might flee to his grace and ay de as they did.</p>
               <p>For by reaſon hereof, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi>

               <p>Neither is it to be doubted, but hee had
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4708:116"/>
humbled himſelfe before God, and had directed his cries, that is, feruent prayers vnto him. For otherwiſe what had that crie of his beene, but diſordered outcryes and howlings, ſuch as Infidels and brute beaſts themſelues ſend forth naturally, when they are preſſed with any griefe or ſorow. And I pray what frute could there be of ſuch a crie?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe when as the Iewes diſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Prouinces, are ſaid to haue cryed out in <hi>faſting, weeping, &amp; great mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> it was before God, before whom they ſhewed foorth ſuch tokens of humilitie, crauing his aide and helpe with earneſt prayers, and theſe like ſignes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For without prayer, without faith and repentance, what could ſackcloth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, weeping, faſting, haue preuailed, but onely to increaſe their contempt and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie?</p>
               <p>Heere therefore, firſt they are woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy commendation, that they take not counſel of fleſh and bloud, neither run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpaire, or ſeeke vnlawfull counſelles, as to make an vprore, ſtirre vp ſedition, fire the Cities, that at leaſt they might not die without reuenge.</p>

The ſprinklings of ſuch a ſacrifice, are faſtings, ſighes and teares: and from that (as from a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) do theſe outward things drawe all the dignitie that they haue: but faith, repentance, hope, are the gifts of God, of his meere grace, which receiue all their dignitie from the onely merite of Chriſt Ieſus and his obedience.

Therefore beeing reconciled vnto God by ſo excellent a price, our repentance which is the gift of his grace, is pleaſing and acceptable vnto him, becauſe that by our humilitie wee magnifie his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and by acknowledging of our ſinnes, wee commend his iuſtice: and in that wee flee vnto him in the middeſt of our miſeries yea and death, he is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the author of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, a gratious, gentle, and mercifull

ſackcloth.</hi> Where by the way we are to note, that the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might either come to their eares, or be in their ſight, whereby they might be made ſadde, (as are cryes, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and ſighing, and the very attyre of the afflicted teſtifying their ſorrowe) would not that any ſhould come into their ſight in ſuch apparell: and beſides that this was vſed to be done by them, that they might driue farre away all memorie and thought of death. But this is not onely a great niceneſſe and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacie, but it is alſo exceeding great and more then barbarous crueltie. For to what ende are Kings appointed, but that they ſhould be the refuge of the miſerable and afflicted? So it commeth for the moſt part to paſſe, that there is no entrance for the diſtreſſed into the houſe, nor any waye or meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne vnto them: but they muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelues with this, that the gate of heauen is alwayes wide open vnto them, in as much as the Father of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen calleth all that are afflicted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and promiſeth them helpe and ayde. Therefore <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> ſeeing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4708:120"/>
he could not enter into the kings houſe, cryeth out in the ſtreetes, that <hi>Eſter</hi> may be certified of this his ſorrow, which alſo came to paſſe by her maidens &amp; Eunuchs: whereat ſhe was grieued exceedingly, and ſent him other garments, that ſo he might enter into the kings palace, but <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> refuſed them. By this wee may know, that <hi>Eſters</hi> gentle diſpoſition and nature, was not altered by her royall dignitie and greatneſſe, but that ſhe had a moſt louing carefulnes towards <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus,</hi> whome ſhe worthily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth as her neere kinſeman, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him in ſteede of her father: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides would gladly relieue him, and if it were poſſible rid him of all care and doubtfulneſſe. A moſt worthie example for all to behold, and namely for migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men, who haue all delights in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that they may learne to relieue the diſtreſſed: for for this end, haue they receiued at Gods hande, riches and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of all proſperitie, that they ſhould communicate them vnto others, and ſuccour the afflicted. That <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> refuſeth the garments offered, it partly proceeded of the greatneſſe of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4708:120"/>
his ſorrow, which he could not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: partly that he would not ſeeme to be carefull of his priuate commoditie, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in mourning, would more and more make app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Ffliction is the tryal of our faith, and the fornance in which there is made manifeſt both the weakenes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of our fleſh; as alſo the ſtrength of the ſpirit, which remaineth in the hearts of the faithfull: it is alſo the whetſtone, whereby wee are ſharpened in earneſt and vehement prayer vnto GOD:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4708:124"/>
and which maketh vs wiſe, to ſeeke the ayd and help of men in a lawfull manner. All which things are moſt euident in this hiſtorie. For in that extreme affliction which hanged ouer the heads of the <hi>Iewes, Eſter</hi> ſtrooken with feare, refuſeth to go in vnto the king to intreate for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> with an inuincible faith and conſtancie, exhorteth her to do her dutie, which ſhe afterward purpoſeth to do, fleeing to moſt feruent and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie prayer ioyned with three dayes faſt, after which, ſhe is fully determined to ſpeake vnto the King for the ſafetie of the Church. So that there are three chiefe points heere to be diſcuſſed, the firſt the excuſe of <hi>Eſter</hi> for feare of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine danger, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. the ſecond the faith and courage of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> in exhorting <hi>Eſter</hi> to the deliuerance of the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. the third the holie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and pietie of this holy woman, being readie againſt all euents and danger for the ſuccour of her people, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. &amp; 16. Theſe examples are propoſed vnto vs, that we may know what we ſhould do in aduerſitie, what meanes we may vſe to be deliuered from them, with what zeale,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4708:125"/>
what faith, what conſtancie and courage the Church is to be defended and our brethren deliuered.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt point, <hi>Eſter</hi> being certified by <hi>Hatach</hi> of the decree made againſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and of the helpe that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did deſire in this neceſſitie, doth excuſe her ſelfe by the great rigour of the lawe, made againſt thoſe who came vnto the King not beeing called, and doth adde, that that was the thirtieth day ſince ſhe had been called to come in vnto the King. This ſeemeth a faire excuſe: for there is lykely to fall on her a moſt euident danger, ſeeing the lawe is manifeſt, and ſo much the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely obſerued, by how much it was more commodious for preſeruation of the Kings Maieſtie. It increaſed her feare, becauſe in thirtie dayes ſhee was not called in vnto the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeemeth to be out of fauour: and ſhe diſtruſteth that ſhe ſhould obtaine her ſuite offending againſt the lawe; and ſo it was to be feared leaſt ſhee ſhould caſt her ſelfe headlong into certayne perill of death, and do no good neither to her ſelfe nor her people. And ſo
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4708:125"/>
                  <hi>Eſter</hi> deſireth <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> to conſider of it, and holde her excuſed. But the feare of priuate danger ought not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright her, but that neuertheleſſe ſhee ſhould, with Gods fauour, trie the Kings minde, and ſeeke to turne it to hinder that horrible ſlaughter. Heereby we ſee, that thoſe who are come to great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and poſſeſſe much which they may loſe, are alſo more fearefull then others: though for the moſt part, men rather care for their owne hinderance, then the common danger. And you ſhall ſcarcely finde any who will not ſeeke ſome excuſe, when he ſhould helpe the Church: and hath not more regard of redreſſing his owne diſcommodities, then of relieuing the brethren. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, it is no great maruayle to ſee a woman affrayde of imminent danger, when it often tymes happeneth, that men, euen of a good courage, bee ſo daunted with dangers, that they leaue their dueties vndone. This is apparant in the Apoſtles, and namely in <hi>Peter,</hi> when they ſawe theyr Lorde (whoſe myracles were yet freſh in memorie, and euen as it were before their eyes)
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4708:126"/>
to be in the hands of his enemies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weake and fearefull men are not to be reiected, but rather to be ſtirred vp and encouraged.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it is to be noted, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient the condition is of vnequall mariage, when one part is greater and more worthie then the other: and how the moſt mightie do moſt eaſily breake the lawes of holy matrimonie, which are theſe; <hi>That the man hath not power ouer his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>bodie, but the woman: nor the woman power of her bodie but the man: and that they ought not to be ſeparated, but for a time, with the conſent of both parties.</hi> Wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue beſides, how kings vnder pretence of their ſecuritie, and defenſe of their princely maieſtie, do very often make ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall and vniuſt lawes, and quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie and repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the end for which they are appointed by God. For what I pray is more contrarie to the office of a good king, then vnder paine of death to forbid any man to enter into his court? What more inhumane then to ſhut the doore againſt thoſe to whom Iuſtice is due? How great a barbarouſnes is it, that the wife dares not come into the preſence
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4708:126"/>
of her husband, but that ſhe ſhall ſtand in danger of death? Thus it commeth to paſſe, that Princes whiles they go about to maintaine their dignitie, do degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into beaſts, ſo that none dares ſafely come neere vnto them: and their throne which ought to be the refuge and ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie of the poore and diſtreſſed, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a place offeare and terror. So did not the good Kings and Emperours in old time, but themſelues would iudge the cauſes of euery priuate man, and heare<note place="margin">1. King. 3. 16.</note> euery one: as we ſee that <hi>Salomon</hi> did pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently heare the controuerſie of thoſe two harlots, and with exceeding wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did decide it. So the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Rome,</hi> did themſelues openly iudge the controuerſies of their ſubiects. Now what a miſerie, and what a miſchiefe is this, the kings houſe and eares are at all ſeaſons open to <hi>Hamans</hi> falſe accuſations and ſlanders, but it is not lawfull for the Queene to make interceſſion to the king for the iuſt defenſe of her ſelfe and her people? I confeſſe that there ought to be great regard to be had of the ſafetie and dignitie of Princes, but they are not to be depriued of clemencie and iuſtice,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4708:127"/>
then which they haue not either ſurer pillers or ſafer defence for their State. And thus farre of <hi>Eſters</hi> excuſe.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> accepteth not of this excuſe, but couragiouſly exhorteth, yea in a manner compelleth her to do her duetie, <hi>Thinke not,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>in thy minde that thou ſhalt be deliuered in the Kings houſe, onely and alone of all the Iewes, For if thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, a breathing and deliuerance ſhall come to the Iewes by ſome other meanes: but thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall periſh: and who knoweth whether thou art come to this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for ſuch a time.</hi> In fewe words hee propoundeth vnto her three chief points of great moment. Firſt, that ſhe is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiued, if ſhe thinke that ſhe alone ſhould be deliuered from the common danger. Next, that if ſhe held her peace, yet God would otherwiſe prouide for his people, and ſhee ſhould periſh. The third point is Gods prouidence, whereby not without ſome great cauſe ſhee was lifted vp into the dignitie royall, to wit, that in this vrgent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſhee ſhould helpe the Church of God. Hee may ſeeme to haue ſpoken
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4708:127"/>
theſe things as a Prophet of God: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſome will ſay, how could hee ſo confidently ſay, that ſuccour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Eſter</hi> if ſhee held her peace ſhould periſh? Yet becauſe hee followeth not the vſuall manner of ſpeech of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Thus ſayeth the Lord,</hi> therefore in this hiſtorie, the words of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> are not to be taken as a Prophecie, but as an application of the generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the lawe and of the Prophets, to this ſpeciall fact. And theſe things will better be vnderſtoode by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of euerie part.</p>
               <p>The drift of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> is to put out of <hi>Eſters</hi> minde the feare of the danger which priuately might light on her, if not beeing called ſhee had gone in vnto the King to make ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Iewes:</hi> that hee might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, hee obiecteth a greater feare vnto her: and that in two ſorts: firſt that ſhee ſhall not eſcape free from this ſlaughter, if by force of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree all the <hi>Iewes</hi> bee put to death: then, ſhe alſo hath cauſe to feare, leaſt if at this tyme ſhee denye her helpe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4708:128"/>
vnto the Church, it ſhould be deliuered by ſome other meanes, and God would puniſh her ſloth and cowardiſe. The firſt point was very likely, if you conſider <hi>Hamans</hi> malice, and his fauour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the King, which was ſo great, that the King eaſily beleeued him in all things. And truly when all the reſt of the Iewes were deſtroyed, as the furie and rage of cut-throates encreaſeth by ſheading of mans bloud, it would be an eaſie matter to perſwade this prophane king, to take away her life alſo, who onely being left aliue of that whole nation, would euen do nought but breath out reuenge for the iniurie receiued. The other point dependeth vpon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, to preſerue and defend his Church, to heare the cry of the afflicted, to ariſe for their help, to haue his eares open vnto their prayers, and his hands ſtretched out to ſaue them; and others of this ſort many, whereof the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full: and on the contrarie part, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the threatnings againſt thoſe who do not help and ay de thoſe who are in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and affliction: and this by force of the couenant made with <hi>Abraham, I will</hi>

How great then is the madneſſe of thoſe, who go out of the Church and abiure the truth, that they may prouide for themſelues &amp; their ſtate? and how great is their furie, who hunt for commoditie onely by the loſſe and ruine of the Church?

               <p>The third reaſon is of greateſt weight, from Gods prouidence, whereby <hi>Eſter</hi> was exalted into ſo great dignitie for ſo neceſſarie a time, <hi>who knoweth,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>whether for ſuch a time thou art come to the Kingdome?</hi> as though he ſhould ſay: God who ruleth and gouerneth all things by his prouidence, euen the very moments of time, hath not without cauſe exalted thee to ſo great a dignitie, by ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a meanes, but that weighing with thy ſelfe ſo great a fauour of God beſtowed on thee, thou ſhouldeſt ſerue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his purpoſe, for the profit and deliuerance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

She might alſo ſay, that ſhe was not the cauſe of this miſchiefe, but <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who would not yeeld vnto <hi>Haman,</hi> or at leaſt keepe himſelfe ſecret, rather then come into his preſence. But a quiet and ſetled minde ſeeketh not ſuch hiding corners full of arrogancie and contempt, but attendeth what his duetie requireth, and trembleth at Gods word. Laſt of all, we are to ſee how <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> and the Church at <hi>Suſa</hi> do alſo their dueties, not caſting all the burden as many do, of the

whole buſineſſe, on <hi>Ester,</hi> but praying with faſting and earneſt ſupplication vnto God, that he will fauour and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per her enterpriſe. So faithfull people ought to pray vnto God for their Kings and rulers, and for all that trauayle or be in danger for the defenſe or ſafetie of the Church, that they faint not vnder their burden.

                     <p>2. And when the King ſawe <hi>Eſter</hi> the Queene ſtanding in the court, ſhe found fauour in his ſight; and the King held out the golden ſcepter that was in his hand: ſo <hi>Eſter</hi> drew neere and touched the top of the ſcepter.</p>

                     <p>4. Then ſayd <hi>Eſter,</hi> if it pleaſe the King, let the King and <hi>Haman</hi> come this day vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>7. Then anſwered <hi>Eſter</hi> and ſayd, My pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and requeſt is,</p>
                     <p>8. If I haue found fauour in the ſight of the King, and if it pleaſe the King to giue me my petition, and to performe my requeſt, let the King and <hi>Haman</hi> come to the banket, that I ſhall prepare for them, and I will do to morrowe according to the Kings ſaying.</p>

of ſuch promiſes in the notable examples of thoſe which call vpon God.

And vnto this appertayneth this example, which euen vnto the end of this hiſtorie wee ſhall intreate of, in which we ſee how <hi>Eſter, Mardochaeus,</hi> and the whole people of the Iewes, after they had called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God in their extreme danger, did feele his bleſſing: and in all their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being happily led vnder his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſawe at the laſt, both an admirable deliuerance of themſelues, and an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion and vengeance on their enimies; that thereby we might more and more finde by proofe, that God will be found to ſaluation, of all thoſe who
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4708:137"/>
in their griefes and euils ſeeke him, and call vpon him in trueth. For the preſent we are to ſee, how God after faſting and prayer did bleſſe the entrance of <hi>Eſter</hi> to the King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and gaue her ſuch fauour, <hi rend="margQuotes">that he was willing to come twiſe vnto her, vnto the banket which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</hi> Wherein there are three chiefe points to be vnfolded: to wit, 1. the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Queene into the Kings court: 2. her entertainement, and choiſe giuen vnto her by the King, to demaund whatſoeuer ſhe would: 3. the wiſedome of <hi>Eſter,</hi> before ſhe would declare the chiefeſt part of her requeſt. An hiſtorie worthie to be throughly diſcuſſed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular of it, that out of euery part we may drawe ſome inſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when the third day was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,</hi> Eſter <hi>put on her royall apparell, and ſtoode in the inner court of the Kings palace, ouer against the Kings houſe: and the King ſate on the throne of his kingdome in the Kings houſe.</hi> It is not expreſſed whether ſhe entred alone, or with ſome companye, but if wee haue regard to the prohibition, that none ſhould enter into the court without commandement,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:4708:138"/>
it ſeemeth that her trayne ſtayed at the gate of this court, into which ſhe alone entred: for ſo great was her charitie, that ſhe would not drawe any with her into danger, being content with theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions onely, Faith, Charitie, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. She adorned herſelfe with royall apparell, not for pride or vaine ſhew, when ſhe was as yet in danger of her life, but for ornament and ſeemeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, leaſt peraduenture ſhe ſhould haue been leſſe acceptable to the King her husband, if ſhe ſhould haue preſented her ſelfe vnto him in mourning apparell. Her bodie then was decked with magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ornaments: but in her heart ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned deepe ſorrowe. Neither is that to be accounted diſſimulation, but wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to obſerue that which was ſeemely in the preſence of the King. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that ſhe rather ſought to pleaſe God then men, when by her three dayes faſt ſhe had made her ſelfe pale and wan: but it was enough that God did fauour her, who granteth beautie and grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will. Wherefore they who are delighted with the noueltie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of ſumptuous and moſt luxurious
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4708:138"/>
apparel, that they may turne al mens eyes to gaze on them, and their tongues to talk of them, glorying in their riches and bewtie, are nothing holpen by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither doth it auaile any whit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their pride and vain-glorie. Neither do we condemne that euery one be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled according to their degree and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, ſo that they ſeeke not new faſhions of apparell and thoſe immodeſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte: and that the heart bee adorned within with true humilitie and the feare of god, with charitie, ſubmiſsion to learne, and modeſtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſter</hi> then entereth with her royal robes into the inner Court, but ſhe dares not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that part of the houſe in which the king ſate, but ſtayed in the inner court ouer againſt the Kings houſe, vntill ſuch time as ſhe might be eſpied by the King; which was not done without feare of that danger which ſhe had caſt her ſelfe into. A moſt couragious enterpriſe of <hi>Esters</hi> proceeding from faith and charitie, by whoſe guidance ſhee ouercame all feare: for ſhe might alwaies think with her ſelfe, that ſhee offended againſt <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> lawe, and that therefore ſhe might bee in like
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4708:139"/>
caſe with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſhti,</hi> for comming when ſhee was not called, as <hi>Vaſhti</hi> was for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming when ſhe was called. This alſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented her feare and diſtruſt, that for a moneths ſpace ſhee had not beene called vnto the king. But on the one ſide, her confidence in the promiſes of God, that he would be with them that feare him and walke in his wayes, and on the other, her charitie and deſire that ſhe hath to helpe the Church, do cauſe her that ſhee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the doing of her dutie before all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>Hence wee are admoniſhed ſtraight after our prayers to ſet hand to worke, and conſtantly to proſecute our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, as we ſee this holy woman to haue done, who after her faſt, early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without any delay, doubteth not to go in vnto the King <hi>Aſſuerus.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we are taught, that our faith, if it be liuely and working through charitie, ſhall neuer bee remooued from performing her duties, whatſoeuer danger ſeeme to threaten vs deſtruction: for faith will affoord vs Gods preſent helpe in the middeſt of daungers, all which through charitie and deſire to helpe others we ſhal

eaſily ouercome. And this is <hi>Esters</hi> fact.</p>
               <p>You ſhall now ſee the happie ſucceſſe which it had from the Lord. Aſſoone as the king ſaw her, <hi>ſhe found fauor in his ſight: and he held out towards her the golden Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and kindly calleth her by her name, adding alſo the titles which belonged to the dignitie royal. <hi>Eſter</hi> alſo <hi>draweth neare, and toucheth the top of the Scepter,</hi> in ſigne of reuerence and ſubiection: which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie moſt beſeemeth al married women. So God <hi>holdeth the heart of the King in his hand, and he turneth it</hi> in a moment <hi>whither ſo euer it pleaſeth him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as is ſaid, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Hee alſo bewtifieth the countenance of <hi>Ester,</hi> with ſweetneſſe and amiable fauor, that ſhemay be the more acceptable. The golden Scepter which is holden forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, is a token of pardon againſt the tranſgreſsion of the law: in that the king calling her by the name of Queen, asketh what ſhe would haue, it is a ſigne of fauour and good will: and in that he alſo inuiteth her to aske, with ſo liberall an offer, euen vnto the halfe of the kingdome, it putteth her in hope of obtaining her ſupplication of the king.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:4708:140"/>For the King might eaſily gather, both by this extraordinarie fact, and by the countenance and geſture of <hi>Eſter,</hi> that ſhe had ſome great thing in her minde. Yet the King was too liberall in promiſing, and might raſhly haue enſnared himſelfe, if <hi>Ester</hi> had bene as readie in demanding, as he was in promiſing. But Kings can hardly moderate themſelues, whether they promiſe or threaten: and ſurely it would better a great deale beſeeme kings, (who oght to do nothing without iuſtice) firſt with good counſell and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation to vnderſtand what is demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, before they binde themſelues by any raſh promiſe. We ſee that it turned vnto euill to <hi>Herode,</hi> that he bound himſelf in a<note place="margin">Marc. 6. 23</note> raſh promiſe: for thereby he defiled both himſelfe and his table with the innocent bloud of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist.</hi> Neuertheleſſe God would haue the minde of <hi>Eſter</hi> to bee filled with good hope and ioy, and aſſurance by this immoderate offer of the King.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Ester</hi> had iuſtly occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, for that ſhe found the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and good will towards her to bee ſo great: what may we do, who haue ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4708:140"/>
and large promiſes from God, as well of this preſent, as of the life to come? For God who <hi>neither can lye nor be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2. Iam. 1. 17</note> doth promiſe vnto vs eternall life, and not a part onely or parcell of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but a full fruition of himſelfe, and all his good things, as it is written, that <hi>God ſhall be all in all:</hi> and that <hi>we alſo ſhall</hi>

If therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to wade out of our euilles and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to haue an happie end of our affayres, to find fauour with the fierceſt men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here the onely meanes and eaſieſt waye; that caſting our ſelues downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with ardent praier, we deſire his helpe, and place our whole confidence in him.

                  <hi>thee ô my ſtrength will I ſing, for God is my defence, and my mercifull God.</hi> Thus you ſee how happie <hi>Esters</hi> entrance was.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare how wiſely ſhe vſeth this proſperous gale of the kings fauour: to wit: <hi>She biddeth the King and Haman to a banket.</hi> In which thing her modeſtie, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and integritie do ſhine: for ſhee doth not abuſe the kings fauor: ſhe breaks not forth by and by into teares, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſobs, as perhaps there ſeemed fit occaſion offred vnto her by the kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and <hi>Hamans</hi> abſence. Her mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie is exceeding great, in that ſhe reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her affections, and patiently expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a fitter opportunitie to complain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king, and make her ſupplication. By this we learne, that we muſt bridle our affectious and paſsions, leaſt we be carried headlong by them, and that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable moderation not to bee raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mooued, although there bee iuſt cauſe of complaint: for oftentimes a iuſt griefe doth driue vs beyond the bounds of moderation, that hardly men or women can temper themſelues, when
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:4708:141"/>
they finde patient eares lent to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that oftentimes the bitterneſſe of our moſt iuſt complaints, doth take much away from their waight and force.</p>
               <p>Her wiſedome appeareth, in that ſhee inuiteth the King to a banquet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee knewe, that thereby ſhee ſhould further procure his good will, for that ſhee had experience that hee was delighted with feaſtes: as in the firſt Chapter wee haue ſeene that hee ſpent halfe a yeare in banqueting and drinkings. So the faithfull know how to vſe things indifferent without euill, to ſerue their commoditie. Yea euen our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, did take occaſion at thoſe banquets whereunto he was bidden, to teach the chiefe poynts of our ſaluation. So he conuerted <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lu. 19. 8. 9.</note> at a banquet: and in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee, he receiued that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable<note place="margin">Lu. 7. 36. &amp;c.</note> ſinner into fauor, teaching the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee the doctrine of faith &amp; repentance; and by the occaſion of being entertained by <hi>Matthew,</hi> whome of a Publican<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 10.</note> hee made an Apoſtle, hee ſhewed the ende of his comming into the world,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4708:142"/>
cleared himſelfe and his diſciples from ſlaunder, and ſet open the doore of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to repentant ſinners. <hi>Eſter</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be blamed, if ſhe ſought the opportunitie of a banket, more fitly to make her ſupplication to the King. But it ſeemeth that her diſſimulation cannot be excuſed, in that ſhe biddeth <hi>Haman</hi> the enemie of the <hi>Church, togither</hi> with the King: but in that ſo much the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth her integritie &amp; vprightneſſe: for ſhe prepareth her complaint to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his preſence, that ſhe might before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand take away all matter of exception and excuſe, laying open the fraude wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did obtaine of the King ſo vniuſt an Edict.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Ester</hi> by thoſe things which might ſeeme to turne to her blame, as though ſhe were guiltie of diſsimulation and treacherie, doth receiue the praiſe of great integritie and iuſtice. For the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked haue no cauſe to complaine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their wickedneſſe be detected pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately or publiquely; whether at a table, or in the place of iudgement; ſo that there be no place for fraudeor deceit: but that the fact bee ſimply and truly propounded:
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:4708:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neither in a good cauſe is it a fault to vſe things indifferent vnto profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. For right and equitie do not depriue vs of the vſe of thoſe things which without blame we may employ in the defenſe of a good cauſe. To be ſilent in proſecuting our right, is not to betray; to deferre til occaſion be offered, is not to do iniurie to the aduerſe partie; it is not crueltie or hypocriſie to bid him to a banquet, whome you meane to accuſe; to entertaine an enimie at a feaſt, is not to lye. But ſome will ſay, it is at leaſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble: I confeſſe it. But all diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not euill and to be condemned. Chriſt Ieſus a great while ſuffered <hi>Iudas</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> at his table and committed vnto him his purſe, as to a good and faithfull diſciple, and yet he knew him to be a diuell and a traytor: of which yet at laſt he warned him at his laſt ſupper. So <hi>Eſter</hi> calleth <hi>Haman</hi> to her banket, becauſe it is not forbidden to do good vnto the wicked: ſhe entertaineth him, and after accuſeth him to the King; becauſe the benefits beſtowed on euill men doth not exempt them from puniſhment, but make them more inexcuſable. Wherefore traytours
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:4708:143"/>
and treacherous perſons are nothing hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by this example in the couering of their fraudes, deceits and guiles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſet vpon good men to oppreſſe them. Neither is this fact yet raſhly to be imitated, but onely the occaſion is to be obſerued, if any like vnto this ſhall happen: for in this preſent world ſo full of miſeries, deceits and entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, wee muſt not onely abſtayne from euill, but alſo from all ſhew of<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 22.</note> euill.</p>
               <p>The King willingly agreeth vnto <hi>Esters</hi> requeſt, and bringeth <hi>Haman</hi> with him, who accounteth it no ſmall honour, that hee onely was inuited by the Queene to accompanie the King. Whiles they were in drinking, the King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> renueth his former promiſe: thinking belike, that <hi>Ester</hi> durſt not propoſe her demaunde for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thing. Therefore againe hee ſayeth, that it ſhall be in her choiſe to demaunde <hi>euen the halfe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> But who can heere ſufficiently wonder at the impudencie and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſpeeches of the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For one of them
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:4708:143"/>
                  <hi>Gabriell Biel,</hi> is not afrayde to ſay, that that which <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> heere offereth to <hi>Ester,</hi> was a figure of thoſe things which God in deede hath beſtowed on the <hi>Virgine Marie,</hi> euen the halfe of his kingdome; For whereas, ſayeth he, the Father of heauen hath theſe two the chiefeſt gifts of his kingdome, Iuſtice and Mercie, reſeruing Iuſtice vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi rend="margQuotes">hee hath graunted Mercie vnto the <hi>Virgine Marie.</hi> Heere hence it is, that amongſt them they giue this title vnto her, <hi>The Mother of Mercie.</hi>
                  </hi> But let vs leaue thoſe blaſphemous ſpeeches, whereof euen the moſt impudent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them are almoſt aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Let vs rather heare <hi>Esters</hi> anſwere, who yet referreth her requeſt vntill the morrow, with that condition, that it will pleaſe the King againe the next day to returne with <hi>Haman</hi> vnto the banket which ſhould be prepared for him. It is not eaſie to ſay what moued her to defer her requeſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had the king ſo ready &amp; eaſie to be intreated to grant whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe would. But whatſoeuer was her purpoſe, it is certaine that God ruled the thoughts of her heart and her ſpeech, that

are vehement paſſions, whereby the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mind is euer toſſed vp and downe, ſo that it cannot long enioy that good which they hane gotten; but by how much the lighter the matter is wherewith they are offended, ſo much the more doo they waxe madde, vnleſſe they bring it to paſſe according to their minde: not knowing, that it is not a ſmall vertue to contemne ſmal things, and ſuch as cannot hurt: and on the other ſide, that it is great wiſedome ſo to rule his affections, that the vſe and enioying of thoſe good things which they haue gotten be not loſt. But <hi>Haman</hi> doth litle eſteeme whatſoeuer riches, eſtimation, dignitie, and honour, which he hath receiued of the King, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe out of hand he be reuenged on <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus:</hi> yet hee is ſaid to haue perforce refrained himſelfe, and come home to aske counſell of his wife and friends. He would no doubt willingly haue laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> as reuenge and wrath do quickly moue the cruel, but he repreſſed himſelfe, becauſe <hi>Mardochae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was as it were in a ſanctuarie, whiles he is in his office in guarding the kings gate: and it wold alſo be accounted a contempt
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:4708:151"/>
done vnto the King, to lay bloudie hands on any of his ſeruants: beſides he thought with himſelfe, that it was better that hee ſhould be put to death with ſhame, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping therein alſo ſome forme of law, then that he ſhould die by open force. Adde hereunto, that God doth reſtraine the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the wicked, that they may not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute whatſoeuer they determine. Hence let vs learn euen by force to reſtraine our paſsions, not onely for a time as <hi>Haman</hi> did, that after they may by deceit and guile obtaine a more cruell effect: but that euill deſires may altogither bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and viterly extinguiſhed in vs, that wee may be obedient to Gods will, and driue out of our minde all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge, and if we haue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie offered, that we leaue our cauſe and reuenge vnto him. And thus far of <hi>Hamans</hi> anger.</p>
               <p>Now being thus full of rage, hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his friends to counſell, and eſpecially his wife <hi>Zereſh</hi> as the chiefe and principall of his counſell. In which thing hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to deale prudently, as becommeth a wiſe man: but, neither was the matter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſuch weight, whereof they did conſult
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:4708:151"/>
neither ought he to come to counſaile ſo enflamed with anger; neither ſhuld he vſe thoſe counſellours who depended onely on his becke, and would ſay and do all things after his luſt; neither was the thing ſo hotly to be propoſed. And truly hee vſeth not ſuch counſellours, who will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to any moderation: but thoſe who will finde a way how they may ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily fulfill his furious paſsion: wherefore it is alſo not any whit to be marueiled at, that the concluſion of this counſell was ſo fooliſh and arrogant. But let vs heare how he propoſeth the matter, <hi>He ſheweth them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children: and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and whereby he had exalted him aboue all the Princes &amp; ſeruants of the king:</hi> &amp; which was euen the heaping vp of his glory, <hi>that he only was broght in by the Queene with the king to the banquet: and that he only was alſo bidden with the king the next day.</hi> To what end all this? that he might procure the greater enuie to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus,</hi> and that his fact might ſeeme the more bold and intollerable, &amp; that therby he might moue his friends to the like rage &amp; reuenge againſt him, &amp; therefore might
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4708:152"/>
deſire them to ſhewe him ſome ſpeedie way whereby he might be reuenged of his enemie, otherwiſe he profeſſeth vnto them what miſerie he is in. For, ſaith he, <hi>All this auaileth me nothing, at what time ſoeuer I ſee this Iewe</hi> Mardochaeus <hi>ſitting at the Kings gate.</hi> That proude recounting of his riches, the multitude of his children, and the honour and dignitie to which the King had exalted him, is a moſt certaine teſtimonie of the munificence, and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of God towards the wicked, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof he doth many wayes powre out vpon them: next, that the wicked do ſufficiently know, their goods, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and greatnes; but neuer attribute them to their true author; whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that they wax wanton in arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, vanitie and fooliſh preſumption: yea and in exceeding crueltie, that it is a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall crime, if any ſubmit not themſelues vnto them, and yeeld not vnto them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honors. Moreouer, the nearer their ende approacheth, the more do they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſet out their magnificence. But this is aboue all moſt worthie of obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which out of <hi>Hamans</hi> owne confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is manifeſt, that the griefe and trouble
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:4708:152"/>
wherwith the wicked are driuen, for that they cannot by and by as they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the godly, who they ſee cannot bee bowed, or brought by any meanes to be ſubiect to their tyrannicall affections; do let that they cannot haue any taſte of their prayſe, glorie, riches, honour, and nobilitie of their ſtocke. So the enemies of the Church of God, to whom at this time all things came to paſſe as they wiſhed, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of goods, honours, eſtates, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and dignities; yet not content ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they deſired to ſee the vtter ruine and ouerthrow of the faithfull. For when they ſaw but one only Prince, louing true godlineſſe, and taking vpon him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Church, al their ioy periſhed and delight, which they ſhuld haue taken of thoſe honours, riches, and fauors which GOD had in abundance heaped vpon them. Yea and the hatred of the Goſpel had taken ſuch deepe roote in the hearts of the poore commons, aſtonied and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched by the conſpirators, the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Haman,</hi> that they can abide none who profeſſeth the ſincere doctrine of the ſonne of God. And what I pray, was the ende and marke of all the counſelles
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:4708:153"/>
and aſſemblies of their cleargie, and of all their Preachers? was it not that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being ſtirred to vproares, ſhould not ſuffer any to enioy life, who would not conſent togither with them to the ſame idolatrie? So then euen with their owne commodities and in the middeſt of their quiet are they troubled, whiles they ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> that is, any one that wil conſtantly ſtriue for god and his truth againſt the errors, pride, and ambition of Antichriſt. Thus haue you the oration of <hi>Haman</hi> to his friends, not from whom hee looked for counſaile, but whome he would kindle with him vnto wrath. But it becommeth vs when we are to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of any matter, not to call to counſell thoſe who will ſpeake for our fauour, and ſmoothe vp our deſires, but graue men, who with all libertie and freedome of ſpeech will admoniſh vs what is honeſt, what is profitable: and all paſsion muſt be far away from our counſels, they muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be gouerned by reaſon, that we may be ready to heare thoſe things, not which pleaſe vs, but which are honeſt and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Finally, if we muſt deliberate of any matter, it muſt be free to diſcuſſe al things
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4708:153"/>
on euery ſide, to obiect, to gainſay, that by ſearch there may be found, what ſhall be moſt honeſt and profitable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are wide from the truth and erre moſt greeuouſly, who asking counſell of their friends, deſire to haue their paſsions approued by them; for in ſtead of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, they finde confuſion: which here wee ſee to haue happened vnto <hi>Haman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſee I pray, what good counſellours theſe friends and <hi>Zereſh</hi> his wife were, <hi>Let there,</hi> ſay they, <hi>be made ready a gallows of fiftie Cubits high, and in the morning ſpeake vnto the King, that they may hang</hi> Mardochaeus <hi>vpon it; and then go in ioyfull with the King to the banquet: which thing when it ſeemed good vnto</hi> Haman, <hi>he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the gallowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this counſell it is plaine, that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being fierce and cruell, had his wife <hi>Zereſh</hi> and his friends as cruel as himſelfe: and therefore by Gods iuſt iudgement, they were at laſt wrapped togither in the ſame deſtruction, God rightfully reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſo bloudie an aduiſe.</p>
               <p>They aduiſe that which they thinke the king will eaſily graunt; ſeeing <hi>Haman</hi> ſo greatly in fauour with the King,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4708:154"/>
and the Kings readineſſe alwaies ſo great in granting his requeſts. Wherby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that men waxe more bold in demaunding things vnhoneſt, when as before they haue very eaſily obtained the like: beſides that, that men are allured with fauour and good will to hope for greater things. They do not weigh that the king receiued a great benefite by the care and faithfulneſſe of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chap. 2. of which fact they could not be ignorant, when as there was open execution done vpon the traytors: they thinke not therefore that ſuch a benefite might come into the kings minde; but they perſwade themſelues that <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> is nothing elſe but a miſerable and vile Iewe without fauour, and already condemned to death: wherehence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that they counſel no moderate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Haman,</hi> but runne headlong into al inhumanitie. But ſurely any wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour might thus haue dealt with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> What ſtand you vpon <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> this Iewe, a man of no account? he is not worthy that you ſhould once thinke of him: do you thinke that your fauour and eſtimation dependeth vpon him, turne
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4708:154"/>
away your mind &amp; cogitation from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him, &amp; be careleſſe &amp; ſecure, is hee not already adiudged to death? But wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> delight in cruel &amp; barbarous cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: for what needed a gallowes offiftie cubites high, vnleſſe it were that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would ſatiſfie their thirſt with the bloud of an innocent, but alſo they lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to expoſe him to all mens ſight, with laughter and reproach? So the enemies of our Lord Chriſt Ieſus were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent we ſee to haue nayled him to the Croſſe, but they would haue him hang in the middeſt betweene two theeues, as a notorious and famous theefe. They adde, that when this is done, he may go in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto the banquet. For the enemies of the Church of God, doo feigne theyr onely ioy in the death of innocents, and doo onely reliſh with delight, thoſe meates which are ſawced with the bloud of the faithfull. So <hi>Herodias</hi> doth little<note place="margin">Mare. 6. 24.</note> care for all the dainties at <hi>Herodes</hi> table, vnleſſe <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> head be brought her in a platter: ſo furious is the hatred wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with euery one of the wicked doth perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute gods ſeruants, &amp; him whom he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be his enemie. This counſell liked
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:4708:155"/>
                  <hi>Haman</hi> well, for it agreed with his paſsion, and he thought he ſhould eaſily obtain it. So is it often done to ouer-looſe and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Kings, who dare denie nothing to thoſe that are about them: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo wicked or inhoneſt, which is not craued at their hands euen with hope of obtaining. He thought beſides, that it would be a pleaſant and a faire ſhew, if he might ſee him who would not bow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before him, to hang with ſhame and infamie on ſo high a galows. Therefore he ſetteth vp the gibbet in his owne houſe, as after we ſhall ſee, Chap. 7. verſ. 9. Neither was it a hard matter for him to get a tree of ſuch a height, when as in the Eaſt the trees are of ſuch a length, that almoſt it paſſeth all credit: or elſe many might be grafted togither, and ſo make the gallows of ſuch height. Neither ought it to ſeeme ſtrange vnto any, that hee erected ſuch a gibbet, when he was in ſo great fauour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and had the kings Ring, &amp; was next in dignitie vnto the king. So by the iuſt iudgement ef God it commeth to paſſe, that the worſt and moſt dangerous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels pleaſe the wicked, as the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of the falſe Prophets did to <hi>Achab,</hi> by whoſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:4708:155"/>
perſwaſion hee went to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> where he receiued his deathes wound, and his armie was ouerthrowne. And as the wicked are delighted with lies, ſo are they eaſily allured by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by a bait, that they may be enſnared in their owne deceirs. And indeed it is iuſt, that thoſe who will haue their wicked counſels praiſed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and do pleaſe themſelues in them, ſhould at the laſt bee taken in their owne nets. But let vs embrace truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie: let vs vſe moderately our ioy and gladneſſe, leaſt we abuſe our proſperitie; neither let vs ſuffer our ſelues to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away headlong with our paſsions: let vs not worke treacherie againſt any, let vs ſeeke for counſell at God, who wil be our guide in all our wayes, defending vs by his power, and deliuering vs from all violence and reproach: and whatſoeuer fall vpon vs heere, at the laſt hee will ſaue vs in his kingdome with Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, to whom alone be glory, ſtrength, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, for euermore.</p>

               <p>VVE are not more troubled almoſt with any thing in the order which God keepeth in the gouerning and adminiſtration of this world, then when we perceiue the wicked to floriſh and bee in proſperitie, when in the meane while, the good do weepe and mourne. But this perturbation partly ſpringeth from this, becauſe we looke not beyond the bounds of this life: partly, for that by reaſon of our impatience, wee cannot expect the notable effects of Gods iudgements; which oftentimes in this world he turneth

on the head of the wicked and vngodly, when the good are meane while deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

               <p>Such is that which in this Hiſtorie is

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:4708:158"/>
and therein the remembrance of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> benefit occurring; the readie will of the king to recompence is; <hi>Hamans</hi> ſo fit comming, though to another end; the queſtion propoſed by the king, of him whome the king would honour; <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> anſwere and conceit of himſelfe; and the kings commandement of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> with triumph through the citie: that in this narration eſpecially, if euer in any, there appeareth the truth of this common prouerbe, <hi>To him that away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, all things fall out fitly.</hi> For what could happen more to be wiſhed for, what more conuenient, as well for <hi>Eſter</hi> and <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> as for all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then that which heere God doth diſpoſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſo many contrarie things to meete heerein together, to the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly, who were greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and to the confuſion and ſhame of <hi>Haman</hi> and his confederates?

               <p>Firſt therefore there is declared, that <hi>when the King could not ſleepe, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they ſhould reade vnto him the booke of the records,</hi> that is, <hi>the Chronicles.</hi> Memorable is that night, becauſe in it by Gods purpoſe and prouidence there was prepared a remedie, whereby the Church ſhould be deliuered from all her feare and danger, and <hi>Hamans</hi> pride ſhould be beaten downe, and all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es of the Church confounded.

So good men watch in defence of the Church and their owne ſafegard, the wicked watch for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction &amp; ouerthrow of the godly, and God taketh away ſleepe from the King,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:4708:159"/>
that by his meanes he may prouide for the ſafetie of his, and heape confuſion on <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> head. Although therefore the kings ſleepe was hindred by ſome natural cauſe, yet God of purpoſe would haue him to watch, and ſent into his heart a deſire to heare the hiſtorie of his owne time. So God either ſendeth or taketh away ſleepe as ſemeth good vnto himſelfe for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of thoſe whom he will help, ſo that he oftentimes waketh who would gladly ſleepe, and he ſleepeth who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly awake, God by this meanes furde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his worke, men for the moſt part not knowing it, or thinking of it, vntill Gods decree be executed. Heerehence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the kings in thoſe times, were not like the kings of our time, who turne the day into night: ſleeping in the day, becauſe they will not do the works of the <hi>light:</hi> &amp; paſſing the night without ſleepe, bicauſe they are delighted with the works of <hi>darknes.</hi> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that is true which the Greeke Poet hath: <hi>A counſellor ought not to ſleepe all night:</hi> but to paſſe whole nights in pleaſures and delights, and to neglect ones duty, is the part of mad men, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowing al modeſtie &amp; honeſtie,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:4708:160"/>
but alſo the very order of nature. But this is to be commended in the king, that for the eaſe of his minde, and not to looſe that time wherein he could not ſleepe, he commanded not bookes of loue, not fables, not trifles to be read vnto him, which at this day courtiers both night and day delight in, but the hiſtorie of things done in his time faithfully written, as before we haue ſeene about the end of the ſecond Chapter. For I pray, who ought rather to be skilfull in hiſtories, and eſpecially of their owne kingdomes then Kings, whereout they may learne examples of all ſorts to enforme the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:4708:161"/>See now how God ſtirreth vp the minde of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> by the reading of this hiſtorie, for he demandeth, <hi>What honour and dignitie hath been giuen to</hi> Mordecai <hi>for this,</hi> and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by his ſeruants, <hi>that there had been nothing done for him,</hi> he doth with aduiſed deliberation purpoſe to do it.

For vnleſſe God by ſome ſecret force of his had wrought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, what hope was there that the king, who when he had the fact of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> as yet in freſh memorie, did not care or thinke of requitall of it, at which time it ſeemeth he would rather haue done it, becauſe lately he was deliuered out of the danger of death, and conſpiracies of the traytours: what hope I ſay was there that hee ſhould be ſtirred vp, ſo long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the dead reading to thinke of the benefite receiued by <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> fidelitie and to requite it? For it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe for the moſt part, that vnleſſe whiles the benefit is freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie it be requited, the grace &amp; eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it periſheth in proceſſe of time, as

men are wont in time to forget thoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> good turnes which we haue receiued ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God or man: as the old prouerbe witneſſeth; <hi>The memorie of a good turne ſleepeth.</hi> That the king therefore asketh whether any honor or recompence hath been done to <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> for it doth ſhew, that for theſe foure yeeres in this reſpect his mind had been very forgetfull. For who ſhould haue been more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then himſelfe, either of a benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, or of not recompencing it? And yet his ſeruants remember it better then he. Howbeit God ſo long a time after, doth not only reuiue it and call it to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, but alſo giue a deſire to requite it. For theſe principles are ingrafted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in euery one, that euery good turne deſerueth a reward, and that the reward muſt be equall to the benefit. Now what greater benefit can kings receiue, then to haue their life preſerued from the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie of traytours, and ſo with their life to haue their ſtates defended? Rightly therefore doth the king thinke that this dutie was worthie to be requited with honour and preferment, and doth alſo determine to performe it. And would to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:4708:162"/>
God that this principle might take deepe roote in the minds of all of what degree ſoeuer they be, high, meane, or low, that thoſe who haue deſerued well of vs, are to be rewarded and honoured according to the abilitie of euery one who receiueth a benefit: for then ſhould we not dayly ſee ſo many vnthankfull mindes, &amp; much leſſe ſo much peruerſeneſſe in altering and extenuating of thoſe benefits which good men haue done, whether to their King, or to their countrie, or to their friends and neighbours. For what can remaine ſound in the publique ſtate and ſocietie of man, if you take away the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of wickednes, and the reward of well doing? The King then doth very well in enquiring whether <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> hath receiued an honour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his fidelitie: the ſeruants do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who remembring wel all thoſe things which had paſſed, do certifie the king of the truth of the matter. And ſurely it is ſeemely that the ſeruants of Princes ſhould ſo marke what is done, that when neede ſhall require, they may be ſure to render a faithfull teſtimonie of euerie thing; not altering any thing either for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:4708:163"/>
hatred or for fauour, which yet courtiers are wont to do.</p>
               <p>The good minde and vnfayned good will of the king to do <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> good, is thereby apparant, that euen earely in the morning hee enquireth who of the courtiers were in the court, that he might conſult with them about the honouring of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> according to his minde. And it ſeemeth that the reading, and the communication of the king with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, continued euen vntill the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that together with the light of the day, God alſo might bring ſome light of deliuerance and ſafetie vnto him who by the moſt cruell determination of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was condemned to a ſhamefull death. Heere the moſt notable and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent prouidence of God doth appeare, that <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> doth not determine of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neither taketh counſaile with his ſeruants who were preſent, what reward and honor <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> ſhould haue, nor in what maner or by whome this honor ſhould be done vnto him. For perhaps it neuer would haue come into the kings minde or the mindes of his ſeruants, to haue deuiſed ſuch a kinde of honor for
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:4708:163"/>
                  <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> as <hi>Haman</hi> preſcribed when he was demanded. Loe how God doth leade and direct the wils and counſailes, the times and ſeaſons, yea the words and talke of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his hidden prouidence, to fulfill that which he hath decreed; and that euen when men know not of it, and thinke or deliberat of nothing leſſe then to obey Gods will, or performe &amp; ſerue his purpoſe &amp; prouidence: on which yet alone we ought to depend, bending our intent wholy on this, to do our duetie faithfully, obey him, and place our whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in him. Behold then how <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> when he came to deſire that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> might be hanged on a gibbet, is moſt fitly by God and the king choſen, to ſet downe the ſentence of moſt high honour to be beſtowed on <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> and himſelfe to be the miniſter thereof: and by this meanes yeeld vnto him moſt exceeding honor, whome he went about to bring to extreme ſhame and violent death. <hi>Haman</hi> was come very early in the morning to ſatisfie his vnſatiable deſire of reuenge, by obtaining authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> with a ſhameful death. So at this day the deadly enimics of the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:4708:164"/>
Church ſleepe not, neither giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues any reſt, but continually are in the Kings houſe, and ſtand at his elbow, and neuer leaue crying in the eares both of the king, and of all that are in any fauour and authoritie with him, to encourage them to the deſtruction of the whole Church. <hi>Haman</hi> is called in out of the vtter court, becauſe (as we haue heard) it was not lawfull for any to go in any farther, vnleſſe he were called by name. Now that he was exceeding ioyfull it is likely: for he thought that by this meanes there was moſt fit occaſion offered vnto him, to obtayne his bloudie demaund. That <hi>Haman</hi> of our time, that day that he was called earely vnto the king, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the due reward for his deſerts, did marueilouſlie reioyce, thinking that there was occaſion offered vnto him<note place="margin">Luc. 6. 25.</note> vtterly to deſtroy and roote out the faithfull profeſſors of the Goſpell. But the matter fell farre otherwiſe then <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſuppoſed, although allured by the firſt ſpeech of the kings, hee nouriſh great hope in his minde, and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto himſelfe greater honors then hitherto hee had enioyed. <hi>Aſſuerus</hi>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:4708:164"/>
therefore asketh him, <hi>What ſhall be done vnto the man, with whoſe honour the King is delighted?</hi> Wiſely doth <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his name whome hee would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but that wiſdome came from God, who would haue thoſe honours due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> to be appointed and deſcribed by the mouth and counſaile of his moſt deadly enemie. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is not probable that <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> would mocke <hi>Haman,</hi> or go about to intrap him: but God did pitch the nets for this proude and craftie enemie.</p>

For many good men are oftentimes ſhaken with the greateſt miſeries and ſorrowes in this life, and on the contrary part, many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; vngodly men liue in proſperitie, &amp; die quietly, as though they had eſcaped gods hand. Howbeit god doth oftetimes ſhew forth in this world, notable ſignes of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:4708:171"/>
his wrath againſt the enemies of his truth. Which although he execute after diuers ſorts, yet this in generall is moſt euident, that they are ouerwhelmed with ſudden miſchiefe, as a woman with childe, and to heare their condemnation before their death, euen by their deareſt and neareſt friends: and that oftentimes the place where they imagined to find reſt and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, is turned vnto a deadly baite. And theſe things in generall are moſt worthy the noting in this Hiſtorie, but let vs alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe euery part thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt heere is offered the modeſtie of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who hauing receiued that honor which we haue ſpoken of before, returneth to his ordinarie office (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) to wit, to the Kings gate: teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that his minde did not ſwell with any pride, but to thinke of his dutie with feare &amp; carefulneſſe, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he is not yet deliuered from all danger, that Edict remaining yet written againſt the Iewes. Beſides, that honour beſtowed vpon him, although it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and almoſt immeaſurable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſtate, paſſed away in one morning, that rightly it may bee ſayd,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:4708:172"/>
if he receiued none other reward, that it was honour without gaine, yea honor full of vain oſtentation and pride onely, and of no firme and ſtable dignitie. But theſe were but an entrance &amp; a ſhew before of greater and more continual honor to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when <hi>Hamans</hi> malice was detected, and worthily puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Heerehence therefore wee learne, not to bee puffed vp and waxe inſolent with any courtly grace &amp; fauour, or any other honor. For the fauour of men is momentanie, and all honor ſlideth away, and vaniſheth as ſmoake into the ayre. It remaineth that wee vſe it well, to the defence and commoditie of the Church, and depend altogither vpon Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not placing our truſt in any earthly Prince, ſeeing that the greateſt and moſt mightie Princes are nothing elſe but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, nay <hi>altogither lighter then vanitie:</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. Let vs beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we be not turned away the leaſt iot from our dutie, by any blaſt of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace or fauour, or from any honeſt thought which beſeemeth vs and our ſtate, and which we ought to preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, euen the moſt precious.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:4708:172"/>
And thus farre touching <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who though hee thought modeſtly of himſelfe, yet he did not ceaſe to comfort and cheere vp himſelfe, conſidering and beholding with himſelfe the wonderfull gouernance of the Lord, who had defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his right, and brought his integritie into light; and honoured his pietie and righteouſneſſe, ſtriking that proud <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> on the other ſide with feare and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when he had deliuered his life out of his bloudie hands. So Chriſtian modeſtie doth not hinder, but that wee may reioyce in thoſe good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things which are offred vs from God, and magnifie the vprightneſſe of his iudgements, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 6. 7. <hi>The righteous ſeeing the ouerthrow of the wicked which boaſted of their wickedneſſe, ſhall laugh,</hi> and giue God continuall thankes for his iudgements. So we ſee <hi>Dauid</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to reioyce, that <hi>God had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:4708:173"/>
which ſpringeth from the ſpirit of God, and a right zeale of his glorie. Loe heere the ioy and gladneſſe of <hi>Mardochaeus.</hi>

               <p>Let vs here now on the contrary <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſorrow and mourning, <hi>He haſted him home mourning and his head couered.</hi> This he did according to the maner &amp; cuſtome of thoſe times, that thoſe who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any notable calamitie, did couer their heads in ſigne of that ſorrowe and griefe which they felt in themſelues: that if it were poſsible they would neither ſee any body, nor be ſeene by any. So <hi>Dauid</hi> flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for feare of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> went bare-footed &amp; his head couered, by this ſigne teſtifying his great ſorrowe which he had for the treaſon of his ſon, his people, and of him whom he ſuppoſed to haue bin a faithful counſellor, <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi> So that as in proſperous matters, by reaſon of ioy, we lift vp our head &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did profeſſe of himſelf, <hi>Thou lifteſt vp my horne as the horne of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorne,</hi> and makeſt me to walke, with an vpright countenance: ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, ſadneſſe throweth downe a mans countenance, and harmes receiued, do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the head with ſhame and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:4708:173"/>Loe heere then <hi>Haman,</hi> who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe high honors and great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, is ouer whelmed with ſhame &amp; reproach: in ſigne whereof hee couereth his head, either with the lap of his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or with ſomewhat elſe: beholde him throwne downe with ſorrow, griefe, and feare, which God vſeth as Bayliffes and Seriants, to draw the wicked into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they may leaue off to waxe prowd in their fond cogitations &amp; vaine hope. And ſurely <hi>Haman</hi> is not ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full without cauſe, partly becauſe he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to looſe that fauour and place which before he had with the King; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he was ſo abaſed before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus,</hi> whom hee eſteemed no better then a dogge: and was forced to bee Vſher vnto him whome hee iudged worthie nought but the gallowes: who could neuer be brought to bowe himſelf before <hi>Haman,</hi> whom yet all other Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers did honour.</p>

ſorrow and fear, without with ſhame and reproach: which thing wee ſee <hi>Dauid</hi> doth moſt times pray for, againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Church: as that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 18. 19. <hi>Let him be cloathed with curſing as with a garment, and let it come as water into his bowels and like oyle into his bones.

                  <hi>let them be put out of the booke of life.</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily then doth he lie ouerwhelmed with ſorrow and ſhame, who went about the ouerthrow and deſtruction of the whole Church of God. By this we learn, that we muſt giue diligent head, that we go not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to worke hurt or iniurie vnto any, if we will haue our ſorrowes to be aſſwaged by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation of the holy Ghoſt; and not to haue them made deadly and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as was this ſorrow of <hi>Hamans,</hi> who ſeeking ſolace for his euils in his houſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his friends and familiars found no where more matter of dolor and diſpaire.</p>
               <p>For when he had declared to <hi>Zereſh</hi> his wife, and to all his friends, all thoſe things
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:4708:174"/>
that had befallen him, he receiued this only anſwere of them, <hi>Seeing that</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus <hi>is of the ſeede of the Iewes, before whome thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not preuaile againſt him, but ſhalt aſſuredly fall before him.</hi> He felt himſelfe alreadie iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged within himſelfe: he ſought therefore remedie among his friends, and by them he is adiudged and condemned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. So it hapned vnto him, which God threatneth vnto the wicked by the prophet <hi>Amos: that if they fled from a Lyon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 5. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>a Beare ſhould meete him, and if he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe and leaned on the wall, a Serpent ſhould bite him.</hi> In this counſell of his friends, <hi>Haman</hi> makes no mention, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his riches, nor of the multitude of his children, nor of all that dignitie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the king had magnified him, but he is compelled to ſpeake of his ſhame and folly. For he reckoneth vp particularly whatſoeuer came to paſſe, to weete, that the king propoſed the queſtion vnto him, of him whome he would honour; his anſwere vnto it; the hope that he had conceiued in his mind; the ſtraight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the king to do all that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which he had ſet downe vnto <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus:</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:4708:175"/>
finally, how all things came to paſſe contrarie to his expectation. This being done, and his wound diſcouered to his friends and familiars, he ſought of them a remedie, whereby either it might be healed throughly, or at leaſt by ſome meanes mitigated. Heere is no mention made of ſeeking vnto God in prayer, or of repentance, or of asking pardon, but onely deceits and wiles to eſcape the hande of God that did perſecute him: <hi>Haman</hi> perſwadeth himſelfe that his wife is not to ſeeke of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and he hopeth that by his friends meanes, hee ſhall finde ſome occaſion, whereby by ſlanders and falſe furmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hee may make <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> odious vnto the King, and at the laſt triumpli ouer him as a conquerour. For the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked promiſe vnto themſelues deliuerance out of all diſtreſſes, by their malice &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits: but oftentimes, in ſteed of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, they finde poyſon. For lo what <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> friends who are called wiſe men, do anſwere in few words, <hi>Aſſuredly thou ſhalt fall before Mardochaeus:</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Becauſe he is a Iewe, and becauſe thou haſt begun to fall before him.</hi> They are not without
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:4708:175"/>
cauſe heere called wiſe men, giuing ſuch an anſwere: for although they were not endued with the wiſdome of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet againſt their wills they make a wiſe anſwere, out of that feeling which they had of the wonderfull works of the God of Iſrael. But what maner of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere I pray, and how vnuſuall? how variable and how changeable are they in their counſailes? for but the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gaue counſell to hang <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> on a gibbet, &amp; yet they knew as wel then that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> was a <hi>Iewe</hi> as now: for ſo <hi>Haman</hi> had deſcribed him vnto them in the Chapter laſt before, ver. 13. Why then did they not thinke ſo at that time as now? Forſooth they endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then to curry fauour with their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, whoſe proſperitie dazeled their eyes: and whereas <hi>Haman</hi> ſought for flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, it was meete that he ſhould receiue hurtfull counſell at their hands. Now his friends are more quickſighted, the miſt of falſe honour beeing remoued from their eyes, and the vayle of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and flattering fortune (that I may ſo ſpeake) wherewith <hi>Haman</hi> was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

wiſe men of this world doo neuer giue ſound counſell to thoſe that are puffed vp with the ſucceſſe of their proſperitie: for their eyes wax dimme with that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blaze; but if aduerſitie happen, then the dimneſſe being taken away, they are cleere-eyed, and they ſpeake the truth more frankly.

But yet not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are not as wiſe as they ſhould be for their friends good.

Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſeeing the Lord ſheweth himſelf ſo plainely by defeating their counſailes, breaking their practiſes, and throwing downe the heads and chiefe authors by violent death, vnleſſe they be altogether Atheiſts, they are compelled at laſt to confeſſe that the godly are preſerued by Gods mightie hand, whome the world goeth about to ouerthrow. We ought to take great comfort by this, and to apply by a true faith vnto our ſelues, as well the promiſes of God, as the admirable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerances of the Church, both in times paſt, and in this preſent age.

ſhee layeth open her petition: for ſhee more eſteemeth of the greatnes of the matter whereof ſhe was to ſpeake and the maieſtie of the king, then that leaue which was granted her to ſpeake freely.

She ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the cauſe of her moſt iuſt petition, and the certaintie of the danger, in that ſhe addeth, <hi>For we are ſolde, I, and my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be destroyed, to be ſlayne, and to periſh:</hi> She ſayeth that they were ſolde, becauſe they were deliuered vnto death, and ſet

in open market as ſheep vnto the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For although there were no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine made of their ſale, yet as thoſe who ſell any thing, deliuer it ouer to be vſed at the will and pleaſure of him to whom it is ſolde: ſo alſo in that Edict which was ſet forth againſt the poore wretches, they were laide open to euery mans furie, as many as would kill, ſlay, or deſtroy them. And indeede ſhee retaineth the very words of the decree, as wee heard them before, Chap. 3. verſ. 13. that thereby ſhe might more and more make knowne the equitie of the demaund. <hi rend="margQuotes">Shee might alſo haue reſpect vnto the offer made by <hi>Haman</hi> of the ten thouſand talents of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, although the King accepted it not, thereby to note his malicious mind, who would not ſpare any coſt to bring his bloudie purpoſe to paſſe.</hi> She adioyneth by way of yeelding, an argument of great modeſtie and humilitie.

               </p>
               <p>But we muſt yet more exactly weigh the vertues of <hi>Eſter,</hi> which doo ſhine in this Oration. For therein as in a Glaſſe, do appeare her wiſedome, faith, charitie, humilitie and modeſtie, her vprightneſſe and integritie, ioyned with an holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Her wiſedome is ſeene in all the parts of her ſpeech. For from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſhe might procure the Kings good will, ſhe maketh no mention of her dignitie, value, merit or worthineſſe, for kings do not willinglie heare thoſe things to bee ſpoken of by their ſubiects and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, but ſhee ſpeaketh onely of the Kings fauour, of his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:4708:184"/>
onely, for which things Kings eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially delight to be commended. It is wiſedome, that in her petition ſhe craueth not reuenge of the iniurie offered vnto her, but ſaith that ſhe will account it in lieu of a great benefite, if her life and the life of her people bee graunted her at her requeſt.</p>
               <p>How great wiſedome alſo is there to be ſeene in theſe words, <hi>Wee are ſolde, I, and my people, to bee deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bee ſlaine and to periſh.</hi> For in fewe words, both ſhee expreſſeth both the truth of the thing, and the barbarous crueltie of the fact, yet ſo, that ſhee toucheth not the King, whom ſhee paſſeth ouer vnnamed, although hee ſuffered that inhumane and bloudie Edict to paſſe. For though Kinges erre and bee deceiued, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to haue their errours in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words to be laid before them, or to bee reprooued. Shee doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo name <hi>Haman,</hi> vntill ſhee had try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kings affection towardes her petition.</p>
               <p>This alſo is wiſely added by her, <hi>That ſhee would haue helde her tongue, if
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:4708:185"/>
they had onely bene ſolde for ſlaues, ſo that it had bene profitable and gainefull to the king.</hi> For Kings are greatly delighted with ſuch humilitie, and liberall offer, that for their ſake and profit, men auoyde no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie. Beſides, nothing could make more to procure hatred and enuie againſt <hi>Haman,</hi> though hee were not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then when ſhee ſayth that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who goeth about the death of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, doeth not care for the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but ſhall rather hinder and endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage him. And this is her wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Her faith is apparant, in that ſhe ſaith, <hi>Let my life, and the life of my people be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me:</hi> And, <hi>I, and my people are ſolde.</hi> For ſo ſhee confeſſeth, and in the middeſt of dangers, profeſſeth that ſhe is of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Iewes, that ſhee embraceth their doctrine and religion, and that ſhee neither hath nor is willing to haue any thing ſeparated or apart from the people of God, but that ſhe would both liue and die togither with them. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that when by <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, ſhe concealed her kindred and her people, it was not done for want
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:4708:185"/>
of faith or godlineſſe, to diſſemble her religion, but of an holy wiſdome, God ſo gouerning both her mind &amp; tongue, that ſhe might more conueniently helpe both her ſelfe and her people, in their greateſt danger. And if at firſt by reaſon of feare there had bene any defect in faith, this confeſsion is ſo plaine, and ſimple, that it taketh away all matter of excuſe from thoſe who in time of perſecution for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare their religion, at what time they ſhould more freely make confeſsion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who when before hee was ſomewhat fearefull, and a ſecret Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Lord, did in the time of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger make himſelfe knowne, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Aramathia,</hi> begging<note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 39.</note> the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and taking it downe from the Croſſe, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with honour into the Sepulchre. How great a ſhame is it then for thoſe that glory in the name of Chriſtians, ſo cowardly to forſweare the Goſpell for feare of loſſe of their goods?</p>
               <p>The charitie of <hi>Ester</hi> conſiſteth in this, that ſhe deſireth nothing for her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but beareth a like care for her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:4708:186"/>
as for her ſelf; and holdeth the church of God more deare then her life. Eaſily might ſhe haue obtained for her ſelfe by name, whatſoeuer ſhee had demaunded without any ones hatred or enuie, by reaſon of that dignitie and ſtate which ſhee held with the King: but with the ſame feruentneſſe of mind doth ſhe make her ſupplication to the king, as well for her people as for her ownelife: which it ſeemeth ſhe ſhuld haue liued &amp; prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged very ſorrowfully, vnleſſe the ſame at her requeſt had bene granted to her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such ought our charitie to be, that we ſhould loue our neighbors as our ſelues, ſo that they who are carefull for their owne ſecuritie and quiet onely, little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what becomes of others, are voyde of charitie, and worſe then Infidels.</p>

It may bee ſaid, that the King did think that the Queene did ſpeak of ſome other fact, &amp; that as yet he knew that ſhe was a Iew: or if hee remembred that fact, hee was aſhamed of it: and, as Princes are wont to ſpare themſelues, did lay the whole blame on an other: or elſe that doubting hee would more truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderſtand the whole matter whereof the Queene did complaine.</p>

               <p>It may be, that by reaſon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and varietie of affaires which Kings do manage, they forget ſome things: but what a negligence and blockiſhneſſe was this, not beſeeming him vnto whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and gouernment ſo many millions ofmen were committed to be ſafely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, to haue ſo little care of a decree made to the deſtruction of ſo many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of all ages, ſexes, and eſtates, that ſo ſoone he had forgotten it?</p>

Neither doth he ſeeme to haue gone out into the garden to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage, but rather to ſharpen his rage, as by the euent of his returne appeareth. But if he had well conſidered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſhould rather haue been angrie with himſelfe and accuſed his owne raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then with <hi>Haman.</hi> For although his malice and crueltie was great, yet it had been of no force, vnleſſe it had been

If Kings be worthily angrie with thoſe who leade them into error by deceite and ſhewe of reaſon, how much more iuſt is their wrath againſt thoſe who by practiſes and conſpiracies, by armes and threatnings, by open force againſt their maieſtie and perſons, go about to compell them, and as it were to make them the miniſters of their priuate reuenge, and the ſeruants or rather bondſlaues of their ambition?</p>
               <p>In the meane while <hi>Haman</hi> maketh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Queene for his life, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:4708:194"/>
for griefe and ſorrow falleth on the bed. Loe, he who would needes be adored by <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> is compelled to lye downe humbly at the feete of his couſin: he that lately caryed his head aloft vnto the skies, altogether ſwelling with arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, breathing out nothing els but threats and death againſt the Church of God, maketh petition for his owne life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtonied with the gripes and ſorrows of death: and as it were hedged in on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide with feares &amp; trembling. And that deſeruedly, he that lately had filled the whole world with threatnings, terrors, and teares, is now aſtoniſhed and feareth, ſtanding as it were at the iudgement ſeate of <hi>the King of feare, to be deuoured by the firſt borne of death,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>Iob.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 13. 14. I confeſſe indeede that the faithfull alſo are griped with great ſorrowes and feares, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, that<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 4. &amp; 55. 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſorrowes of death compaſſed him, that feare and trembling came vpon him, and an horrible feare couered him:</hi> but in time they receiue comfort, &amp; are deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their feares. For as the cauſes of griefe wherewith the godly are affected, are far other then of the infidels, ſo likewiſe the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:4708:195"/>
iſſues of both are very different: for only deſpaire followeth the one, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well in life as in death accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the other. <hi>Haman</hi> hoped that <hi>Eſter</hi> would be more eaſily intreated to grant him his life then the King, whoſe wrath he knew to be violent, and not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed: howbeit he found her as well as him not to be intreated, God ſo reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Queenes affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might exerciſe iudgement without mercie, on him who neuer vſed mercie. Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that <hi>Eſter</hi> could not with a good conſcience make interceſſion for him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king, and deliuer him from death, who with ſo great a crueltie had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the vtter deſtruction of the Church. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> excellently teacheth in the Prouerbs, <hi>He that iustifieth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 17. 15.</note>

Heerehence ſprang the Prouerbe, Deliuer a thiefe from the gallowes, and he will hang thee thereon if he can. Yea it is an vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mercy to let a wolfe eſcape with his
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:4708:195"/>
life, who can do nothing but hurt the ſheepe. Wherefore by very good right, he who had wrought the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the poore faithfull ones, who had appointed a ſhamefull death for <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> that ſame day, he himſelf is couered with ſhame, and hath no man to take pitie of him: as <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth and wiſheth againſt the enemies of the Church, <hi>Let there be none to extend mercy</hi>

               <p>The king in the meane while returning out of the garden, and perceiuing <hi>Haman</hi> to be fallen downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bed whereon <hi>Eſter</hi> ſate, is reported to haue kindled with greater furie, and to ſay, <hi>Wil he force the Queene alſo before mee in the houſe?</hi> The wretched man was fallen downe vpon the bed, whereon the Queene after the maner of that countrie ſate at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the feaſt, being aſtoniſhed with griefe: the king perſwadeth himſelf, or faineth himſelfe to beleeue, that hee would offer violence vnto the Queene, that might haue the better ſhew of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to condemne him to death: although that thoſe who are angrie, do faine any thing againſt thoſe whome they hate,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:4708:196"/>
though they be neuer ſo vnlikely, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth. <hi>Haman</hi> then is accuſed by the king as one that would haue vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Queenes chaſtitie. And the word is to be noted which he vſeth, <hi>Will he alſo force?</hi> as though he ſhould ſay: Is it not enough for him that by his wiles he hath layd ſnares for the Queenes life, but that alſo he wil force her in the houſe before my face? And theſe things do make his fault the more hainous. So hee who with his falſe accuſations did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme euery man, and troubled the whole world, and filled all things with violence, he is himſelfe oppreſſed with a falſe ſurmiſe, and is accuſed as a violater of chaſtitie.

in this reſpect, <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> doth him iniurie; and anger hindereth him that he cannot in this caſe ſee the truth, ſo that he iudgeth otherwiſe of <hi>Hamans</hi> fact then he ought: for there was not any the leaſt ſuſpition of this fact in reſpect of his preſent eſtate, neither was the Queene left alone without companie.

For being as it were made of nought but ſinne, they are readie for any miſchieſe, if occaſion only<note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 4</note> be offered vnto them, as the wicked is ſaid to abhorre nothing that is euill.</p>

And ſurely it is right that his face ſhould be couered, that he may looke for nothing but for the darkneſſe of death; who would haue taken away the light of life from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

which at this time and vpon this occaſion and circumſtance is right and iuſtice, is not ſo at others: Beſides that euen in the ſame countries, there are obſerued diuers formes of iudgements, according to the diuers circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of time, fact, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

Moreouer, what neede we to be carefull to cleare the actions of an heathen and infidell king, when it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth many times that chriſtian Princes do ſlip and erre in their iudgements?

               <p>The King therefore acknowledging his error in chuſing <hi>Haman,</hi> is now more wiſe in the choiſe of an other, whoſe fidelitie towards the King, wiſedome and modeſtic in gouernment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie in aduerſitie, and moderation in honour, were ſufficiently before hand tryed.</p>

               <p>She ſheweth alſo her zeale and charitie in the reaſon which ſhe bringeth in theſe words, <hi>How can I behold the euill, which ſhould come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my people, and how can I ſee the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my kindred?</hi> for it is as much as if ſhe ſhould ſay, that ſhe had rather loſe her life, then with her eyes to behold the deſtruction of her people &amp; kindred;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:4708:212"/>
and that nothing ſhould be afterward more bitter vnto her then her life. And ſo very openly ſhe witneſſeth, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth nothing more, eſteemeth nothing more, then to be accounted amongſt the people of God: neither is ſhe aſhamed to ioyne her ſelfe to that people whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned vnto death, euery one contemned: &amp; this alſo made much to moue the king to ſeeke a remedie for this almoſt incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miſchiefe. The faith and charitie of this Queene is ſo much the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, how much the rarer it is: ſeeing we ſhall find but a few at this day to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the zeale of the houſe of God. Let vs then at the leaſt by her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, with humble prayers call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King of heauen, that he will turne away from our brethren, the wicked counſailes and craftie practiſes of our enemies. For although the head of this League &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours, the oppreſſor of the Church of God be deſtroyed, yet many remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this venime, and the furie of his crafts and practiſes euen at this day euery where moueth warres, and filleth al places with ſeditions &amp; moſt deteſtable apoſtaſies.

                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:4708:213"/>The anſwere of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> is full of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie and gentlenes, and in granting the protection of the Iewes, eaſie &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: but yet it ſheweth a troubled mind, when he ſayeth, <hi>That he had done what he might, hauing condemned</hi> Haman <hi>to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, who would haue layd his hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes, and hauing giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his goods vnto</hi> Eſter: <hi>and that he doth now moreouer permit, that they write for the Iewes, as it ſhall ſeeme good vnto them:</hi> but yet he addeth, that <hi>the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which was written in the Kings name, and ſealed with the Kings ſeale,</hi> could not be called backe. Notwithſtanding what could be done in fauour of the Iewes, but it would be contrarie to the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation?

And if God
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:4708:213"/>
himſelfe had not holpen the poore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, it is moſt certaine, that the former proclamation would haue had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force. Heere then let vs rather admire Gods prouidence, then praiſe the Kings wiſedome. Theſe things are written for our comfort, that in our greateſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, and hardeſt diſtreſſe, when the miſchiefe ſeemeth paſt remedie, we flee vnto him who made a way for his people through the midſt of the ſea: who lighteneth our moſt thickeſt darknes by the brightnes of his light: who openeth the graues, who deliuereth vs out of the ſhadow of death, as heretofore he preſerued by wonderfull meanes his people, and the three children caſt into the fierie fornace, and finally <hi>Daniel</hi> in the very den of Lyons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the kings humanitie and courteſie is to be commended, who ſo willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that they ſhould write in fauour of the Iewes: but it is no maruell if he could not by his owne wiſedome wind himſelfe out of ſo intricate a buſines, and therefore committed the whole matter to the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and wiſdome of <hi>Mardochaeus.</hi> Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euident, that Princes neede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then faithful counſellors: It is

therefore our parts to obtaine them by our prayers for our Princes at the hand of the Lord; and to pray that God will direct their minds to follow the aduiſe of faithfull and good counſellors.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:4708:214"/>
vnto all that <hi>Mordecai</hi> commanded, vnto the Iewes, and to the Princes, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and rulers of the Prouinces, which were from India, euen vnto Ethiopia, an hundred and ſeuen and twentie prouinces, vnto euery prouince according to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, and to euery people after their ſpeech, and to the Iewes according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their writing, and according to their language.</p>
                     <p>10. And hee wrote in the King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> name, and ſealed it with the Kings ring: and he ſent the letters by poasts on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and that roade on beasts of price, as dromedaries, and coltes of mares.</p>
                     <p>11. Wherein the King graunted the Iewes (in what citie ſoeuer they were) to gather themſelues together and to ſtand for their life, and to roote out, to ſlay, and to deſtroy all the power of the people, and of the prouince which ſhall inuade them, their children and women, and to ſpoile their goods.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 8.</note> For in the midſt of diſtreſſes, which no wit of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could haue remedied, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth altogether on Gods prouidence: and teacheth vs, that in all hard and doubtfull matters, we muſt do our dutie, and vſe that wiſdome which God giueth vs, leaſt we be fearefull like the infidels, and leaue the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; doubts which we can not redreſſe, to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and moſt wiſe gouernment, who hath promiſed to be a light vnto vs in
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:4708:215"/>
our moſt thickeſt darkeneſſe. This alſo we ſee to be performed by <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> in this Hiſtorie: for, the King graunting him leaue to write what letters he would in fauour of the Iewes, and yet not reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the former which were written for their deſtruction, it is not to be doubted, but that he wreſtled with many doubts &amp; diuers feares; perceiuing the Kings mind to be mutable and eaſily chaunged: and beſides, foreſeeing many daungers, after what manner ſoeuer he ſhould write the decree. For, as wee heere ſee the Edict written, to graunt the Iewes, that beeing gathered togither, they might ſtand for their life againſt all that would as enemies inuade them: was it not to ſet them open to a hard and moſt daungerous Combat, againſt the naturall ſubiects of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, armed no leſſe with the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, then the Iewes, who were onely poore captiues and ſtraungers, and farre leſſe in number then their enemies? <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> therefore in theſe ſtraights, did what he could in dutie, and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie graunted him from the king, remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole euent of the matter vnto the mercie of the Lord, whoſe wonderful
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:4708:216"/>
meanes in deliuering of his Church, hee had alreadie had experience of, in that happie end of ſo many dangers, which the minde of man could not haue thought on: hoping that it would come to paſſe, that God who had begun the deliuerance of his Church by ſo ſudden and vnhoped meanes, would perfect the ſame vnto his glorie. Here then we are to conſider how <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did prouide, that this new proclamation might go forth abſolute in all parts and forme, and what was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and argument thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall be obſerued his wiſedome, equitie and diligence, in guiding and furthering the publike affaires of the Church; which are particularly to be vnfolded by vs, that in all things we may obſerue the care and direction which God beareth ouer his: and how he diſpoſeth all things for their ſafetie and commoditie, as oft as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good vnto him; and that ſo we may learne, to reſt vpon his fatherly care, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not with ſtanding our dutie, as much as in vs lyeth.</p>
               <p>The ninth verſe, declareth the time wherin that proclamation was made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of the Iewes: by whom, vnto whom,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:4708:216"/>
and how it was carried. The time, is the 23. day of the third moneth, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Siuan,</hi> which anſwereth to part of our <hi>May.</hi> Whereby it is apparant that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict went forth two moneths &amp; ten daies after the other, which as we ſaw Chap. 3. verſ. 12. was made the thirteenth day of the firſt moneth. Beſides from the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of this Edict vnto the execution therof, there was eight months and about twentie dayes: For as in the next Chapter we ſhall ſee, it was fulfilled on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the twelfth moneth. The time is thus preciſely noted, not onely for the certaintie and truth of the Hiſtorie: but alſo that the ſtate of the Church may be ſet before our eyes, what it was at that time, firſt for the ſpace of thoſe two monethes and ten dayes, wherein it was halfe buried, as it were being condemned to death and deſtruction, which ſeemed impoſsible to be auoyded. After, how in the ſpace of other eight moneths, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as it were to breathe againe, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her ſelf to her iuſt &amp; lawful defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: yet not without many difficulties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe might be feared, vntil God gaue her a full victorie ouer her enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:4708:217"/>God therefore will haue the eſtate of his Church to be ſuch in this world, that ſhe ſhal ſeem ſomtimes to be oppreſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of reſtoring, ſometimes armed with ſome iuſt defence, ſometimes alſo to haue the vpper hand of her enemies: that ſo being tryed by all meanes, ſhe may the better know her infirmitie, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred wherewith ſhee is troubled by the world: and yet not withſtanding that ſhe hath her whole defence reſting in God alone by whom ſhe is ſtayed vp, and who as oft as it ſeemeth good vnto him, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all things to her profit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. We ſee then, that the people of God was accounted as miſerable and paſt hope, as well in the opinion of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as in their owne judgement, hauing the ſentence of death pronounced againſt them.</p>
               <p>And this was not a little profitable vnto them, that they might the better be ſtirred vp vnto repentance, which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie is neglected: and that ſhe might be made like vnto the ſonne of God, who was conſecrated by afflictions: and that the wonderfull power of God in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his, might be the more knowne. For
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:4708:217"/>
if there were no oppreſsion, where were deliuerance? vnleſſe we were plunged in the darkneſſe of death, how ſhuld that light of life whereby God quickneth vs be knowne? God therefore being about to ſhew forth any notable deliuerance, and great worke of his glorie, firſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his to be drowned, &amp; as it were ſhut vp in the graue, that in their ſafetie, his glorie may by ſome more excellent means ſhine moſt cleare, and the hand of god may be acknowledged in it, and that it may be ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath done it.</hi> But he exerciſeth his Church ſometime more greeuouſly ſometimes but lightly, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lengtheneth or ſhortneth the time of calamitie, as hee ſeeth it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yeelding them ſtrength and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, according to the meaſure of the time which hee hath preſcribed vnto the affliction.</p>
               <p>Afterward there is expreſſed by whom the decree is written, to wit, by <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus,</hi> who did endite the ſubſtance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto the Scribes, who brought it into forme as he preſcribed. Heere then the king affoordeth the ſame fauour vnto <hi>Mardochaeus, which before he did vnto
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:4708:218"/>
Haman,</hi> permitting to his pleaſure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was needfull to be done, ſo that he were not compelled to recall in expreſſe tearmes, the former proclamation. In which thing, the King may worthily bee ſaid to haue dealt inconſiderately, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that whole matter vnto one mans will and pleaſure, which ought to haue beene done with great deliberation and ſtayed counſell. For although in plaine words the former decree was not reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet of neceſsitie this muſt be made contrarie vnto it. But yet not without the exceeding great wiſedome of God, do theſe things thus come to paſſe: for if the counſellors had bene called togither, perhaps they would not haue conſented, to a decree ſo fauourable for the Iewes ſo contrarie to the former, and ſo hurtfull vnto the Kings naturall ſubiects. But ſo much the greater was the care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> becauſe he alone muſt ſuſtaine the whole hatred and enuie of that proclamation.</p>
               <p>And it is not to bee doubted but that hee was greatly troubled, when hee ſhould endite that Edict vnto the ſcribes; ſeeing that he was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>late raiſed to that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:4708:218"/>
ſo great dignitie, in a place ſo ſlipperie, and in the guiding of matters of ſo great weight, euen which concerned the whole ſtate of ſo great a Monarchie; hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to do with a King ſo vnconſtant, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe beſides, hauing in ſo fewe yeares, bin the beholder of ſo many changes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God gaue him ſufficient wiſedome, as hee is wont to beſtowe gifts neceſſarie vpon all whom he calleth to any lawfull vocation.</p>
               <p>The Scribes are called, not to ſet downe their opinion, but to write as they were commanded. Wherefore they doo not admoniſh the King nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the repugnance of this Edict with the former, neither of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence which might fall out by it, neither of the dammage which ſhould come to all the Kings ſubiects, who ſhould deſtroy themſelues by ciuill mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereby appeareth, that the kings authoritie was on all ſides abſolute, and that none durſt gaineſay him, or except any thing againſt his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
               <p>Such at this day is the authoritie of the Turk; but the better and more moderate
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:4708:219"/>
Princes are wont for the moſt part to heare the opinion of their counſell, and ſeruants. Now theſe Scribes it ſeemeth cared not what they wrought, ſo that they were aſſured that it was the Kings will.</p>
               <p>The proclamation is appointed to be ſent to the Iewes, becauſe it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ſecuritie: then vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Captaines and chiefe Gouernours of the Prouinces, that they ſhould publiſh it, and leaſt that they ſhould hinder the Iewes in their iuſt defence; &amp; that thoſe who had receiued the former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king, ſhuld now be certified of his contrarie pleaſure. So we ſee that the king doth little eſteeme what his Lieftenant and gouernors would iudge of ſo ſudden a change, and ſo contrarie opinions and decrees. Whereby it appeareth what fearefull and abſolute or rather immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate dominion he exerciſed ouer his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Theſe think themſelues to be gods, that may not be reprehended nor repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſo that no man may ſo much as looke into their actions, much leſſe gainſay them.</p>
               <p>The manner of the writing of the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:4708:219"/>
Proclamation is diuers, according to the ſtile and language of euery prouince, that no man might pretend ignorance. But if the commandements of earthly kings ought to be written in all the tongues of their ſubiects, how much more the lawe of the eternall <hi>Iehouah,</hi> which none can be ignorant of without certaine loſſe of their ſaluation?</p>
               <p>Of thoſe to whome the letters are committed to be caryed into the ſeuen and twentie prouinces, we ſhall ſpeake more commodiouſly afterward, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. So that heere we are to weigh that which is ſayd, <hi>That they were written in the Kings name, and ſealed with the Kings ſeale.</hi> For ſo they were made authenticall without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For as in theſe dayes Kings and Princes, are wont to ſeale their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents with great ſeales, that they may adde force and authoritie to their graunts and commandements, that ſame were the kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> wont to do with ſealing with their ring. The King then ſawe and allowed what ſoeuer the Scribes had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the commandement of <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus.</hi> So we ſee that it is moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight that Kings heare and ſee thoſe things which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:4708:220"/>
are publiſhed in their name vnto their ſubiects, eſpecially in things of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for otherwiſe neither can they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the note of ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eleſneſſe, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor their counſellors of deceit and treaſon, if letters ſhall be ſent out in the Kings name concerning the eſtate of the kingdome, which the King neither ſawe, nor with ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deliberation did weigh and conſider.</p>
               <p>Let vs now then view their ſubſtance and argument, in theſe words; <hi>That the King graunted vnto the Iewes (in what citie ſoeuer they were) to gather together and to ſtand for their liues, and to roote out, and to ſlay, and to destroy all the power of the people and of the prouince which ſhould inuade them, their children and wiues: and to ſpoile their goods.</hi> In theſe later words there is ſome ambiguitie and doubtfulnes: for it is vncertaine whether the Iewes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to kill, not only their enemies, but alſo their wiues and children: or onely to kill thoſe who would oppreſſe them their wiues and children? But this later ſence doth better agree with the humanitie of the faithfull, neither is it likely that <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> without Gods expreſe
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:4708:220"/>
commandement, would haue women and children to be ſlaine. But ſome man will except: that the enemies of God and his Church are worthy to feele that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which without cauſe they threatned vnto others. But there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no ſuch thing in the execution which ſhortly after did follow. So that to auoide all ambiguitie and doubtfulnes of ſpeech, the Hebrue may be thus tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>That it was graunted vnto the Iewes by the king, that they ſhould ſlay all thoſe that went about to lay violent hands on them, their wiues or children: and that the ſpoiles of the enemies ſlayne was giuen by the King to the Iewes.</hi> So that the ſumme of this Proclamation was, that it was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King vnto the Iewes, that they ſhoulde be gathered together to defend their liues, and to deſtroy all thoſe that would offer them or theirs any force or violence, and beſides to ſpoile their goods. So that they were not to ſet vpon any, but vſing their lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to kill thoſe that did lye in waite for their liues. And this is moſt rightfull, that being armed with the authoritie of the chiefe Magiſtrate, they might fight

for their life, for their libertie and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the defence of their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and as the Prouerbe is, for their Temples &amp; houſes. For this cauſe warres are lawfull, whereby the inrodes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſions of enemies are repreſſed: in ſo much that they who take away from the faithfull the ſword of lawfull defence as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> do, do make a way for the wicked, and let looſe the bridle to all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of robberies: and do as it were lay open the innocent bound hand and foote to their furie: and beſides condemne all the Saincts the faithfull ſeruants of God, <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Ioſua,</hi> the <hi>Iudges, David,</hi> and almoſt all the other good kings, who did leade the Lords hoſtes, and fought his battailes. In the meane while the former edict not being reuoked, doth ſtill retaine his force, and ſo there ariſe heere great difficulties, ſo that it ſeemeth that there is ſmall prouiſion made for the ſafetie of the Iewes. For who would hope that the naturall ſubiects of the king being more in number, and firſt ſtrengthened with the Kings authoritie, could be ouercome and defeated by the Iewes, being onely ſeely captiues, diſpearſed here and there,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:4708:221"/>
without armour, without authoritie Beſides is it not likely that the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the prouinces would either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly or openly rather encline to their owne mens ſide then to the Iewes. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it beeing graunted that the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours would encline to neither part, are not the naturall ſubiects rather ſtirred vp by this meanes againſt the Iewes, euen to thirſt their bloud, when as they were firſt armed by the Kings authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and had moe wayes to ſet vpon them then the other had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend? Without doubt <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did ſufficiently perceiue theſe inconuemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But what could hee do? Only this procure that it may be lawfull for the Iewes to vſe their iuſt defence, and hope that God would helpe their iuſt cauſe, as hee had alreadie begun to fauour and bleſſe his people, and that hee would ſend a feare vpon their enemies: which thing the iſſue did confirme. Hee did alſo ſuppoſe, that when they ſhoulde knowe the cauſe wherefore <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged, and vnderſtande whereupon this newe decree was graunted, and heare of the fauour which the Iewes
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:4708:222"/>
had with the King, as well in regard of <hi>Eſter</hi> the Queene, as alſo for <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> ſake, they would all ſlake that anger they bare vnto the Iewes, and abſtaine from inuading them, ſeeing by that meanes alſo themſelues might be quiet. For as the fauours and graces of Princes doo leane either to this part or to the other; ſo are the wills and affections of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects changed.</p>
               <p>Heerehence alſo is to be obſerued, that Kings, howſoeuer they woulde ſeeme to keepe their lawes holie and inuiolate, yet by ſubtile and by-wayes they oftentimes ouerthrow them. The King would by no meanes ſeeme willing to depart from his former commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which notwithſtanding by this contrarie decree, hee ouerturneth, and in deede taketh away. Had he not dealt better with his ſubiects, expreſſely to haue reuoked that former decree, then by this to ſet them thus together by the eares. For this inuading on the one part, and defence on the other, could not be done without bloudſhed on the one ſide or the other, or both. But Gods prouidence ruled and guided all theſe
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:4708:222"/>
things, that the enemies of the Church might receiue the puniſhment they had deſerued. Heere is alſo farther to be noted, that the wicked counſailes of the enemies of the Church, are made deadly both to themſelues and their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. And although alſo after their death they leaue behinde them the effects of their treacheries and conſpiracies, yet at the laſt they are all ouerturned, to the great confuſion of thoſe, who ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their moſt wicked counſailes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> retaineth the very termes of the former edict to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the enemies of the Church, when hee ſayeth, that it is graunted to the Iewes to kill, ſlay, and deſtroy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might perceiue, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which they had prepared for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould fall vpon their owne heads. And euen in this age, beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, do we ſee the experience of all theſe things. For after the death of that <hi>Haman</hi> the head of the League, wee haue ſeene the force of former edicts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and other proclamations ſent out from the King againſt his companions and confederates, vnto whome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:4708:223"/>
licence was before graunted to deſtroy the godly. Theſe are the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable works of our God, which no man can ſufficiently wonder at, and in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation where of all our ſenſes will faile. For God doth fulfill thoſe things before our eyes, which no man could expect, or ſo much as hope for.</p>
               <p>There is a ſet day apointed for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter throughout all the prouinces of the king <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> to weete the xv. day of the xij. moneth, which is the moneth <hi>Adar,</hi> and which was appointed for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Iewes: ſo that the day which was by <hi>Hamans</hi> malice prefixed for their ruine and ouerthrow, by the goodnes of God ſhould be turned into ſafetie and deliuerance. Vntill that day came they might at leiſure meete, and prepare and furniſh themſelues with things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for their iuſt defence, diligently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing as well the number of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as their purpoſes and ſtrength whereby they prepared to ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them or by what meanes they ſought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

be moſt fit to obtaine an happie iſſue of their deuiſes and practiſes, God doth appoint for their deſtruction: whereof wee oftentimes haue had experience. And thus farre of the dutie of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſee what is commanded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gouernors: <hi>That the coppie of this writing ſhould be publiſhed among the people, in euery Prouince; and that the Iewes ſhuld be ready againſt that day to auenge theſelues on their enemies.</hi> This might ſeem hard vn to the Lieftenants and Gouernors, who lately had publiſhed an Edict altogither contrarie vnto this. But they were in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection euen as ſeruants, vnto this great Monarch, neither dared they as much as to ope their lips againſt his pleaſure. But what I pray could they imagin, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw ſuch contrarie commandements, but that either the King was vndiſcreete, or vſed euill counſellors, or elſe was deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the mutuall hatreds and diſcords of his ſubiects, and would therfore make tryal which part was ſtrongeſt? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they go on, and proclaime the Edict.</p>
               <p>Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:4708:224"/>
the Iewes are ſufficiently furniſhed to be reuenged on their enemies. Although then priuate reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge be in expreſſe words forbidden. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 39. Yet the publike granted by the magiſtrate in a iuſt cauſe is alwaies lawfull, and commaunded by God.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth thankes vnto God,<note place="margin">Pſ. 18. 41.</note> that <hi>hee had giuen him power to auenge himſelfe.</hi> It is likely that many contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this decree, as being wreſted from the King by the importunitie of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and perſwaded themſelues, that the King indeede would not haue thoſe things to be done, which were contained in that Edict, and that therfore they wold ſtand vnto the former.</p>
               <p>But by this meanes God drew on his enemies vnto the day of ſlaughter. So diuers in our time truſting vnto that Edict, which was firſt made againſt the profeſſors of the reformed religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the Kings latter Edicts, but as trifles and to be laughed at. Which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion yet was and will be to their hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>Let vs now paſſe ouer vnto thoſe by whoſe diligence thoſe Letters were caried
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:4708:224"/>
into all Prouinces, to wit, by the hand of ſwift poſtes, which rode on the beſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and beaſts prouided for the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: for the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> vſed to haue ſtage poſtes, prepared for the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of euerie Prouince, that ſo in ſhort time they might receiue newes of the whole affaires of the Kingdome, or ſend into the Prouinces as need required: of whoſe faithfulneſſe no man would doubt ſeeing they had commaundement from the King.</p>
               <p>So God prouided, that his ſhould ſpeedily receiue the gladſome tidings of theyr deliuerance, that in their anguiſh they might be comforted, and in their ſorrowes cheared and made glad: and that by the effect it ſelfe he might approoue vnto them, that he had heard their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and vnderſtood their cries.</p>
               <p>So when it ſeemeth good vnto the Lord, all things are chaunged, and turned vnto the good and ioy of the Church. For the Kings will and lips wiſh and ſpeak whatſoeuer ſhall be for theyr profit: the Scribes write that which <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> commaundeth them, who ſetteth downe that which he thinketh
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:4708:225"/>
neceſſarie for their preſeruation: the Princes and Gouernors they publiſh that which they are commaunded; the Poſts ſpeedily carie the Letters into all Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So God is wont to comfort his after afflictions. Let vs therefore wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, ſerue him continually in feare, patiently expect his helpe, looking vntill he make vs ioyfull in Chriſt Ieſus, by whom our ioy is purchaſed; to whom be glorie for euer.</p>

               <p>Firſt here is mention made of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glorie of <hi>Mardochaeus:</hi> then of the ioy and gladneſſe of all the Iewes: and laſtly of the feare where with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were affright. The glory of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> is commended by two things: the firſt is, his eaſie acceſſe vnto the King;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:4708:227"/>
the other his gorgious and precious appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, for he is ſaid, <hi>to haue come out from the preſence of the king in royall apparell of blew and white, and with a great Crowne of Gold.</hi> Such was their apparell whom the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> would honour, and vnto whom they gaue the chiefe places of dignitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, that they might gouerne the weightieſt affaires of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>For it is ſeemely that thoſe who are called by the King to the gouernment of their State, ſhould be diſcerned by ſome notes, whereby their dignitie and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie may be knowne, and authoritie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured vnto them by that meanes: now by purple and fine linnen, and a golden Crowne, the higheſt dignitie which was next vnto the Kings was noted. For great Princes will haue certaine ſignes of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:4708:228"/>
were at the laſt ſought for comlineſſe and ornament, and for notes and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of dignitie. <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> then did not himſelfe of his owne minde prouide this apparell, ſo to boaſt of his dignitie, but admitted ſuch as the King comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after the manner and cuſtome of the Perſian Kings. Whereby it is apparant that the faithfull may with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience vſe all things that are meane and indifferent ſo that they retaine godlineſſe, modeſtie, and charitie; not proudly lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt others, nor pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering &amp; delighting themſelues in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, neither abuſing that fauor &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which they haue receiued. So <hi>Daniel</hi> of whoſe holineſſe noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doubteth, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued pretious ornaments, a chain of gold, and purple, when they were offered him by the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Wherefore holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and rich ornaments of apparell, are not contrarie one vnto an other: neither religion and the gouernment of publike affaires; nor humilitie or modeſtie, and high authoritie in thoſe that vſe it well. For <hi>Ioſeph, Daniel</hi> &amp; <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit the leſſe holy, for that they be apparelled in precious garments: nor the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:4708:228"/>
                  <g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>TXT
leſſe religious, for that they gouerned the affaires of mightie Monarches: nor the leſſe humble and modeſt, for that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to high honor. Nay on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, pride many times lurketh vnder courſe clothing, and often they who exerciſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly functions haue not the moſt godlineſſe, and vnder the emptie <hi>ſhew</hi> of holineſſe, hipocriſie and diſsimulation lie hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>Lo here how god can in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t change the miſerable condition of his ſeruants, into an happie and flouriſhing eſtate, that his power in this matter may be the more apparant.

What then could <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> ſay, but that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſaith after he had prayed for the helpe of God to deliuer him? <hi>Thou haſt turned my mourning into ioy, thou haſt looſed my</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Might he not alſo rightly ſay that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which is, Pſ. 31. 7. 8. <hi>I will be glad and

reioyce in thy mercie: for thou haſt knowne my trouble, thou haſt ſeene my ſoule in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſitie: and thou hast not ſhut me up in the hand of the enemie, but haſt ſet my feete in a large roome.</hi> Neither doth that any leſſe agree vnto him which the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith. <hi>Thou art a place to hide mee in,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So God for the moſt part is wont to diſpoſe the affaires of his, that great ioy ſhall ſucceed great ſorrow, &amp; great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe follow after many teares; that great glory ſhall enſue after great diſgrace, and after great abaſing, high honor and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, whereof the knowne examples of <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> do make proofe, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> himſelfe doth acknowledge in theſe words, <q>Thou haſt cauſed me to ſee great<note place="margin">P ſ. 71. 20. 21.</note> troubles and aduerſities, <hi>but</hi> thou wilt againe reuiue me, and take me vp from the depth of the earth.

giuing, and adorned with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the exceeding glorious workes of the Lord. For if the very <hi>Ethnickes,</hi> in whom there was any ſparkes of honeſtie left, were wont in their feaſts, to treate of graue and honeſt matters, and to tell of the falſe miracles of their Gods: what is ſeemely for Chriſtians to do vnto whom ſo abundant an argument of praiſing god is offered, as wel in the former deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his church, as in theſe latter which daily we ſee to be performed? but ſome man will ſay, there is not yet ſo great an occaſion offered vnto the Iewes of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but that by reaſon of the dangers to enſue, there remaineth yet much more cauſe of feare and carefulneſſe.</p>
               <p>For the former Edict as yet being in force, and the Iewes hauing many enemies, who are as well armed with publike authoritie to inuade them, as they are for their owne defence, dooth there not ſeeme to be greater occaſion of feare and dread, then of ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? eſpecially ſeeing the ſucceſſe of warres is ſo diuers: and when as no part ouercommeth without greate loſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:4708:231"/>It is not to be thought that the Iewes did ſo giue themſelues to ioy, that they were not carefull for their affaires, or did not prouide themſelues againſt the day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and no doubt to this end did they often call vpon God in their prayers. The ioy then that was bred in their hearts for this new benefit which they had receiued from God, did likewiſe encourage them to hope the more boldly for that which was to come, becauſe God being ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a workeman, is not wont to leaue his worke imperfect, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 8. it is ſaid, <hi>The goodneſſe of the Lord endureth for euer, and that he neuer for ſaketh the worke of his hands.</hi> The Lord therefore doth ſo make glad thoſe that are his, that not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he leaueth them ſufficient occaſion to pray vnto him, and to looke carefully vnto their affaires. And yet not with ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding leauing vnto them a certaine pledge and earneſt of full deliuerance, he giueth them hope of happie ſucceſſe, which yet dependeth wholy vpon him: as alſo the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 26. 12. <hi>Thou ô Lord wilt giue vs peace; for thou alſo haſt wrought all our works for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is added in the end of this
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:4708:232"/>
verſe, might auaile much to raiſe vp the Iewes into a good hope, to weete, <hi>that many of the people of the land became Iewes; becauſe the feare of the Iewes fell vpon them.</hi> So that it came to paſſe, that on the one ſide many for deſire tooke part with the Iewes; on the other ſide they were ſtriken with feare, whoſoeuer went about to procure their death. That it is ſayd that many of the people of the land were made Iewes, may thus be vnderſtoode, that either they tooke part with them, or that they did embrace their Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the God of the Iewes for the true God, who alone can ſaue and deliuer out of danger, thoſe that put their whole truſt and confidence in him. And this is one of the fruites which is gathered out of danger, thoſe that put their whole truſt and confidence in him. And this one of the fruites which is gathered won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull deliuerances of his church, that many who before were ignorant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed or euen hated and perſecuted the Church and her doctrine, when as they perceiue that ſo mightily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deliuer his out of the iawes of their enemies, and not only our of their teeth, but euen almoſt out of the bottome of their belly, and bowels as it

were, whereinto they ſeeme quite to haue ſwallowed them, then they take part with the Church, and confeſſe that this God only is to be worſhipped &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. So when God had by ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles tamed and ſubdued <hi>Pharao</hi> and all <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after the laſt plague when his people went out with an high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand, a great multitude ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to goe together<note place="margin">Exo. 12. 38.</note> with them out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> In the time of <hi>David,</hi> when as he had obtained thoſe noble victories, many ioyned themſelues vnto him, ſome (as himſelfe ſayeth) for<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note> ſeruile feare, ſome willingly, and of their owne accord. Many ſtrangers alſo follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the people, returning out of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as it is ſaid in <hi>Ezra,</hi> that<note place="margin">Ezra. 2. 59. 62.</note> ſome were put from the Prieſthood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not their genealogie. In the Chriſtian Church alſo, when as after that <hi>Licinius</hi> was ouercome by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Church ceaſed, which had continued almoſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres together, an innumerable company of people which before ſerued idols, was content to be receiued into the Church. So it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that thoſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:4708:233"/>
miraculous deliuerances of the people of God, are not onely profitable vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but alſo turne to the ſaluation of many idolaters: ſo that the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth a double benefit by this helpe from God, that is, both her protection and defence, and her encreaſe alſo and multiplication: ſo that as <hi>Iſai</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 49. verſ. 21. <hi>She marueileth whence ſo many children are borne vnto her, who was ſo long barren, and as it were a widow.</hi> We are therefore to wiſh not the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſtruction of thoſe that hate vs, and perſecute vs of a falſe zeale, being bewitched by the falſe doctrine of the Papiſts; but rather their conuerſion and ſaluation. And if any come into the Church, either by force, or for feare and in hypocriſie, in that alſo God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for that his enemies are forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his power, and confeſſe his maieſtie, and yeeld ſome ſigne of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Hence then did there ariſe vnto the Iewes good hope that many would ſtand on their part, and on the other ſide alſo they receiued great comfort, when they ſawe that the feare of them fell vpon the people. For this feare was from God,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:4708:233"/>
who as oft as it ſeemeth good vnto him, taketh away courage from the mightie, and maketh them fall away like water, that either their weapons fall out of their hands, or be turned to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And the holy Scripture often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this feare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God protected his, but terrified their enemies: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 5. the feare of God is ſaid to haue fallen on all the cities neere vnto <hi>Sichem,</hi> that they dared not follow after <hi>Iacob,</hi> whoſe ſonnes <hi>Simeon</hi> &amp; <hi>Leui,</hi> had ſpoiled the citie of <hi>Sichem,</hi> and ſlaine the inhabitants thereof.

By this meanes were our idolatrous Leaguers deceiued, who by force of the Bulles and Pardons they had from the Pope, of their Iubilees, Pilgrimages, and Proceſſions, of their madneſſe in the worſhipping of images, and fooliſh deuotions, and by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellings of certaine Almanacks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of other like leger-du-maines, did promiſe vnto themſelues the wiſhed and happie end of their purpoſes, which was the aboliſhing of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and doctrine of the Goſpell: but the time and day which ſeemed vnto them moſt fit for their deſignements, was turned vnto them into a day of ſorrow, ſhame, and eternall confuſion.</p>
               <p>Hearken now what way the Iewes tooke by the Kings permiſſion to deſtroy their enemies, <hi>They gathered themſelues together in their cities through all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And ſurely then had they moſt neede of Gods help, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were to fight with their enemies: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God had daunted their courage, and weakened their force &amp; proweſſe, there was no hope that the Iewes could be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers of their enemies. Furthermore, they contained themſelues within the bounds of the Proclamation, that they would only vſe force againſt thoſe that ſought their hurt: that is, thoſe that were in armes to hurt them, their wiues and children: for this was the forme of the firſt edict, chap. 8. verſ. 11.

Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the King was not very carefull of the quiet and ſafetie of his people.

               <p>Moreouer, the feare of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> had taken hold of them, that when they ſaw him in ſuch fauour and authoritie with the King, and that all things were guided by his counſell, and ruled at his becke, they would alſo ſeeke to gratifie him.

For hee that exalted <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> and made him to be reuerenced and feared of the Princes, and preſerued vnto him his dignitie ſafe and whole, knoweth alſo by what meanes to defend and protect thoſe whoſe worke he will vſe, to the defence of his Church, ſcattering and turning to nought all the craftie counſels of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <p>But heere eſpecially this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did aſcend vnto this honour by theſe ſteps, godlineſſe, the feare of God, zeale of his glory, a pure affection of helping and defending the Church; ſo farre forth as it pleaſed God to put to his hande to giue any quiet and tranquillitie vnto the Church, which was ſo miſerably afflicted.

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:4708:248"/>
was too great libertie granted to a ſtrange people againſt the naturall ſubiects, and that the courage of his people was too much daunted. But none of all theſe things come vnto his mind, but he goeth merily vnto the Queene, reioycing for her ſake at the number of thoſe that were ſlaine, and againe giuing her libertie to demand whatſoeuer ſhe liſt. For theſe are the words of our author: <hi>The king ſaid vnto</hi> Eſter <hi>the Queene, The Iewes haue killed and deſtroyed in</hi> Suſa <hi>the citie royall fiue hundred men, and the tenne ſonnes of</hi> Haman: <hi>what haue they done in the reſt of the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces? Now what is thy demand, and it ſhall be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, or what is thy petition moreouer, and it ſhall be done?</hi> By theſe words he doth partly gratifie <hi>Eſter,</hi> in the reuenge abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her enemies: partly alſo giueth her power to do ſomewhat more if ſhe liſt, that nothing may be omitted which ſhe would deſire to the full reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge on the enemies of her people. Whereby it appeareth, that hee did all theſe things more vpon paſſion then by reaſon, and that he would rather pleaſe his wife in the affection of his loue, then haue care of his ſubiects in regard of iuſtice. For ſeeing he
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:4708:248"/>
was an infidel, he ſought not Gods glory, whome he knew not, neither the quiet of the Church, whoſe doctrine he did not vnderſtand. And if in regard and loue of iuſtice he would haue repreſſed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his ſubiects, which ſought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Iewes, yet vnleſſe he had caſt off all humanitie and all care which a king ought to haue of his ſubiects, he wold haue lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that the bloud of his people armed at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, ſhould ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably haue bin ſhead. Among the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations of a good Prince, this is not the leaſt, that he hold the bloud of his ſubiects deare &amp; pretious: and prouide by good lawes and conſtitutions that by tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults bloud be not ſhead, and that it be not made lawfull by a confuſed libertie warranted by the lawes, for one to make aſſault vpon an other. But for the moſt part it commeth to paſſe that Kings little eſteeme the life of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom they thinke onely to be borne for their pleaſure: ſo that they ſell nothing for a leſſe price, many times more carefull of a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or honor, then of the preſeruation of many thouſand me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s liues, as though that loſſe might moſt eaſily of al be recouered. But whatſoeuer heere hapned, God did
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:4708:249"/>
vſe this ſcarce humane affection of the king towards his people, and his ouergreat willingneſſe to pleaſure the Queene, to the procuring of peace and tranquillitie to his Church, and to the taking of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon the hatred and deſpite of his enemies. So great then is the goodneſſe of God, that he maketh al things to turne to the commoditie and profite of his: ſo great alſo his wiſdome and puritie, that thoſe things which are raſhly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratly done by men, he conuerteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his glorie. For we ſee that <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> doth not any thing heere aduiſedly, but onely of a vehement and forcible affection to pleaſe his wife: who, if he had had many an immoderate and vnmodeſt woman, would haue forced him to do many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt and wrongfull matters. And indeede it is not ſeemely for kings to be too large and prodigall in their promiſes; and to ſubiect the liues of his ſubiects and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of their affayres vnto the luſt and pleaſure of a woman.</p>
               <p>This ſo liberall a grant made vnto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſhe demandeth, <hi>If it ſeeme good vnto the King, let it be granted vnto the Iewes which are in</hi> Suſa, <hi>to do to morrow according
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:4708:249"/>
vnto this dayes decree; and the tenne ſonnes of</hi> Haman <hi>to be hanged on the gallowes.</hi> By this demand, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly manifeſt, that many who either by bearing of weapon or ſome other meanes, had the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed themſelues enemies vnto the Iewes were eſcaped, the Iewes not being ignorant therof, becauſe they were not ſufficient in number to follow them: farder alſo it appeareth, that the tenne ſonnes of <hi>Haman</hi> conſpired or conſented with their father vnto the deſtruction of the Iews. But this demand of the Queene at firſt bluſh may ſeeme to proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too much deſire of reuenge: for was it not ſufficient that in the citie of <hi>Suſa</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there were ſlaine with the edge of the ſword fiue hundred men, but that ſhee muſt alſo deſire to rage yet more cruelly againſt thoſe that had eſcaped, when as euen in the moſt bloudie battailes, and between the moſt deadly enemies, after the furie of the conflict, thoſe who haue eſcaped, either yeeld themſelues, and ſo are to be caried into bondage, or ſet free for their ranſome; or elſe the victorie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth ſuffice? Beſides, doth not that ſeeme alſo to paſſe the bounds of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:4708:250"/>
to deſire to haue the tenne ſonnes of <hi>Haman</hi> to be hanged with ſhame and reproch, being alreadie ſlaine, when as many haue granted buriall vnto their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies being ſlaine? But the godlineſſe of <hi>Eſter</hi> which ſhe ſhewed in all her life, doth hinder that we ſhould thinke that ſhe gaue place to any paſſion: but on the contrarie, wee muſt rather ſay that ſhee ſought the glorie of God in the reuenge of the enemies of his people, and the quiet and tranquillitie of the Church, which thoſe who were eſcaped might when they ſawe their time diſturbe, and therefore ſhe deſired that the reſt might be puniſhed, and <hi>Hamans</hi> ſonnes hanged on the gallowes as they had deſerued, for example vnto thoſe who are not a ſhamed to abuſe the name, authoritie and forces of the King, to effect their wicked coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels &amp; practiſes; and to the deteſtation of thoſe, who with all their power go about the deſtruction of the Church. So that the free ſpeech and holy boldneſſe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> is rather to be prayſed in following the puniſhment of the wicked, then to be condemned as though ſhe had bin a ſlaue vnto her affections. For we reade that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:4708:250"/>
God hath approued the like puniſhments againſt the wicked and vngodly, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the ſeuen ſonnes of <hi>Saul,</hi> who were deliuered by <hi>Dauid</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 20.</note> to be hanged on the gallowes, becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> had broken the oth and faith giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of old time by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 25.</note> Beſides, God commanded the Princes of the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had led the people into wickednes with the idols &amp; women of the <hi>Madianites</hi> to be hanged; and many thouſands of the reſt of the people to be ſlaine with the ſword, ſo to ſatisfie the wrath of God. So <hi>Gedeon</hi> not content<note place="margin">Iud. 7. &amp; 8.</note> with this, that the <hi>Madianites</hi> were ſlaine with their owne ſwords, doth follow with all his force vpon the reſt, and did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute puniſhment for example vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vpon thoſe who being requeſted would not help him. God forbid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we ſhould reproue as faultie, all ſharp and ſeuere puniſhment which is executed againſt the enemies of Gods people. Notwithſtanding whoſoeuer he be that will imitate ſuch examples, muſt firſt moſt diligentlie ſearch his owne heart, that vnder a falſe pretence hee giue not place vnto any euill paſſion

                  <note place="margin">Luc. 9. 44.</note> which ſhut their gates againſt the Lord when he would haue entred.</p>
               <p>Now the King heere ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as eaſie to be intreated in granting the petition of <hi>Eſter,</hi> as he was in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For hee is reported to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that it ſhould be done, ſo that there was a Decree giuen at <hi>Suſa,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they hanged the tenne ſonnes of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> As ſoone then as <hi>Eſter</hi> had ſpoken, the commandement was giuen and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, God ſo enclining the kings heart, that the Church might afterward enioy the more firme peace and tranquillitie. For otherwiſe it might worthily ſeeme a wonder, that the King ſhould make ſo little account to ſpend the bloud of his ſubiects, whome he ſo eaſily layd open vnto the ſlaughter: and that he feared not ſedition in his people, or that he was accounted by them a Tyrant, who by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But hee neuer thought on any of theſe things: it was enough for him to gratifie <hi>Eſter.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that his power was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently eſtabliſhed: whereby he was the bolder to diſpoſe of the life of his ſubiects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heereby alſo we may perceiue; how mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table the fauour of Kings is: and how ſhame and reproch do follow thoſe who abuſe their honor and proſperitie.</p>
               <p>The commandement being publiſhed, the Iewes are readie for the execution: for it is ſayd, that the <hi>Iewes which were at</hi> Suſa, <hi>gathered themſelues together vpon the fourteenth day alſo of the moneth</hi> Adar, <hi>and ſlew three hundred men in</hi> Suſa, <hi>but layd not their hand on the ſpoyle.</hi> In which, their conſtancie and boldneſſe deſerueth high commendation, &amp; admiration: for they might haue vſed many delayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and caſt many doubts; they might haue excuſed themſelues that they ſhould runne into hatred and the note of bloudthirſtie men: and moreouer might haue pretended that it was to be feared, leaſt heereafter the Kings minde changing, they ſhould be called to an account for the ſheading of

ſo much bloud: as wee ſee that ſuch wounds often waxe rawe againe though they ſeeme healed, in all ſtates, ſuch a ſlaughter being made, how good ſo euer the cauſe be. They might alſo except that there was more commendation in remitting ſomewhat of their right, and dealing mercifully, then in proſecuting their iniuries with extreme rigour. But when as they perceiued that they were called by God, and armed with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the lawfull Magiſtrate; and did ſet before their eyes the chearfulneſſe of their aunceſtors in executing Gods iudgements, they ouercome all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and execute the worke they are commanded, looking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that God would no leſſe be praiſed and glorified in the puniſhing of his enemies, then in the mercy and protection ſhewed vnto his.

               <p>There followeth after, how theſe things

became a perpetuall law and cuſtome by the decree of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> which <hi>Eſter</hi> the ſecond time doth confirme, as wee ſhall ſee after, verſ. 29. <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> then as a Magiſtrate <hi>wrote and ſent letters to all the Iewes which were in all the prouinces of the King</hi> Aſſuerus, <hi>farre and neere. Inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them that they ſhould keepe the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the moneth</hi> Adar, <hi>and the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth thereof, euery yeere:</hi> adding this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>According to the dayes wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their enemies, and the moneth which was turned vnto them, from ſorrow to ioy, and from mourning to mirth.</hi> He noteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that the memorie of Gods benefits and graces doth ſoone ſlip away, except it be ſtayed by ſome notable meanes, wherefore hee commandeth that thoſe two dayes wherein they obtayned the victorie ouer their enemies ſhould be kept holiday, that they might reſt in them with an holy reſt, thereby to call to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the benefit of ſo great a deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and to celebrate the grace of God, who by a wonderfull meanes did turne their ſorrow into ioy. In which thing he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the dutie of a good and faithfull Magiſtrate, whereof it is a part to take
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:4708:264"/>
care that good order be preſerued in the Church, the worſhip of God retained pure, and the memorie of his benefits continued for euer: that in all ages euery one may learne to put his truſt in God, and to looke for all help and good from him. Heereby then we learne, that when the chiefe Magiſtrate neglecteth thoſe things which make to the conſeruation of pure religion, becauſe he is ignorant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the inferior Magiſtrate ought not therefore to ceaſe, but by reaſon of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, procure whatſoeuer ſhall appertaine to the nouriſhing and preſeruing of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: as heere we ſee, when <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> little careth for the doctrine of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which he did not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> doth not therefore leaue off, but decreeth thoſe things which he thought to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the maintaining of the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſo memorable a deliuerance. Wherein there ſhineth not onely his pietie and care of the Church, but alſo his courage and conſtancie. For it could not chooſe but be odious vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue inhabitants, when they ſhoulde yearely ſee this feaſt to be celebrated, and ſo call to remembrance the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:4708:264"/>
and deſtruction of their fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by the Iewes: ſeeing that no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or ſignes of victorie or offences amongſt the people adioyning, can be beholden without indignation and great griefe. But the memorie of the benefites receiued from our God is not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the griefe and ſorrowe of minde, which the ignorant take at the remembrance of true religion. Yet is it wiſely to be foreſeene, that after ciuill warres there be nothing done, whereby the minds of men may be offended, and olde wounds wax greene againe, and warre eftſoones ſtirred vp. Hence alſo we learne, that it is the duetie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magiſtrate, either to decree, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue by his decree, that which is alreadie by authoritie well ordained, to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and eſtabliſhing of the good order of the Church, and the outward ſeruice of God, ſo that the word of God be alwaies the rule and ſquire whereby hee frame all his actions. And this is ſo much the more diligently to be noted and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, by how much wee ſee that the ſlippe is eaſie in that part, when the queſtion is concerning the power of
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:4708:265"/>
Magiſtrates in the ordering of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall matters. For ſome graunt vnto the higheſt Magiſtrate, to ordayne in the Church whatſoeuer pleaſeth them, or whatſoeuer ſhall be perſwaded vnto them by others. But what is this other then to ouerthrow all religion, by granting ſuch licence vnto men? So we ſee that the kings of Iſrael cleauing to their owne opinions did peruert the pure worſhip of God: and alſo the kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> imitating them, when leauing the doctrine of the lawe, they followed their owne wiſdome and ſence, as by the example of <hi>Achaz</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> it is apparant. Otherſome will not haue the Magiſtrate to take any care at all of Eccleſiaſticall matters, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the Pope holdeth, to vphold more eaſily his owne tyrannie. What is then heere to be done? That the Magiſtrate inuade not the Paſtors office, as to preach the word, adminiſter the Sacraments: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he change not or innouate any thing in religion at his owne pleaſure, or by worldly wiſdome and policie: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that he is appointed of God a keeper and defender of the Church, of wholſome and heauenly doctrine, of the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:4708:265"/>
worſhip of God, and of order requiſite in the Church, hee vſe his authoritie and ſword to the defence of the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all force, that the Paſtors may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their right and authoritie, and that thoſe who are ſlothfull may be ſtirred vp: that ſound doctrine, and the right vſe of the Sacraments may be conſerued; and that by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Paſtors good lawes may be made, agreeable vnto ſound doctrine, that all things may be done in order conuenient in the houſe of God. And if the times be ſuch that the ſtate of the Church be altogether depraued, and neede reformation; the dutie alſo of the Magiſtrate requireth, that he ſet hand vnto the worke, &amp; prouide that all things be reſtored to their integritie, according to the word of God rightly vnderſtoode, and applied vnto his right vſe and end. So we reade, that the holy kings of the<note place="margin">I.

Out of all which examples, let the faithfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates learne what parts and place they hold in the Church.

the chiefe cauſe of this ordinance, which is heere expreſſed, to weere, the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Haman,</hi> which by the wiſdome of <hi>Ester</hi> returned vpon his head: <hi>verſe 24. and</hi> 25.

               <p>This is then the eſpeciall and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe cauſe of the yearely celebrating of thoſe two dayes, the malice of <hi>Haman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>It is moreouer to be noted, that this feaſt is not dedicated vnto <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> or vnto <hi>Eſter,</hi> but vnto the liuing God onely, who onely is to be called vpon in the Church.

And thus farre of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> letters.</p>
               <p>It followeth after, that <hi>Eſter</hi> alſo wrote letters to confirme, and by her authoritie to eſtabliſh theſe things, and that they were ſent to all the Iewes through the hundred and ſeuen and twenty prouinces
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:4708:271"/>
of the king <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> with words of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and aſſurance: and that therby thoſe dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> were yet farther confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and eſtabliſhed. This iterating done by <hi>Ester,</hi> was not without cauſe, or that ſhe might bee talked of: but it is likely, that both ſhe and <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did feare leaſt the Iewes which were diſperſed through ſo many Prouinces, would by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little waxe forgetfull of ſo great a benefit. And namely, becauſe thoſe daies of <hi>Purim</hi> could not be celebrated without the indignation and griefe of the reſt of the inhabitants of that regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that the memorie of thoſe that were ſlaine, to the number of ſeuentie and fiue thouſand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that eight hundred which were ſlain in <hi>Suſa,</hi> and the tenne ſonnes of <hi>Haman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it would be the harder to obſerue this feaſt. Vnto al which you may adde, that it was to be feared leaſt after that <hi>Aſſuerus, Ester</hi> and <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> were dead, the fauor of the Iewes ſhould decay; and in ſtead of that fauour which they had receiued, there might riſe vp
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:4708:272"/>
ſome new conſpiracie againſt them: as for the moſt part it commeth to paſſe, that old brawles &amp; hatreds are eftſoones renewed, and that the remmembrance of hurt ſuſtained with diſgrace, can hardly or almoſt neuer be put out of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minds. Therefore ſo much the more diligently did they renew this commandement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: the end whereof is principally to be noted, which is expreſſed in the end of the 31. verſe: <hi>that it ſhould be a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their faſting and of their prayer:</hi> that is, by theſe feaſts they would erect a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument for euer, by which it might be teſtified, that God had regard of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, heard their prayers, and was the author and furtherer of ſo great and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a deliuerance. The ende then of thoſe feaſts was an open teſtifying before all men, that God aboue doth help thoſe who caſt downe themſelues before him, and call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his name. Which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall fruite to be reaped by this whole Hiſtorie, leaſt that we be diſcouraged in perſecutions: but rather that wee ſhould be the more ſtirred vp to ſeeke God in time conuenient, being aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that he is neare vnto them that

call vpon him in truth, and ſeek him with an vpright heart: and that it ſhall come to paſſe, that thoſe that put their truſt in him ſhall neuer be confounded. By this example of <hi>Eſter,</hi> all women whom God hath lifted vp vnto any dignitie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, are taught ſo to vſe that fauour and authoritie which they haue, that they may procure good order to be ſtabliſhed in the Church, and to labour that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of Gods benefites towards her be neuer blotted out: being aſſuredly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that if they be carried with a right zeale of the glorie of God, their names be written in the booke of life: and that the acts performed by them are regiſtred moſt faithfully in the Lords mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So the auncient Chriſtians came to togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre euery day without difference, to heare the word of God, be partakers of the Sacraments, and to praier and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe indeed, that the Apoſtles, that they might winne the Iewes vnto the Lord, did frame themſelues vnto their diſpoſitions, to wit, taught in the Temple, and in the Synagogues on the Sabboths and holy dayes, which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Hiſtorie of the Acts.

ſhould come togither to bee taught, and to employ themſelues with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in holy exerciſes. And it ſeemeth vnto me moſt likely, that the firſt day of the weeke wherein Chriſt roſe againe from the dead (called therefore the Lords day) was rather choſen then any other to be dedicated to that holy meeting as it is eaſily gathered out of 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. but yet without law or comandement, or any band of neceſſitie, but onely to keepe an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This concluſion of this booke is now to be weighed by vs, with a briefe recapitulation to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the chiefe points of thoſe things which we haue expounded, that we may conſtantly expect our peace and quiet from his grace and fauour, who in all ages hath granted it vnto his Church, after that he hath exerciſed it for a ſeaſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diuers afflictions.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is ſayd, <hi>that king</hi> Aſſuerus <hi>layed a tribute vpon the land, and vpon the yles of the ſea.</hi> There is mention made of this tribute as of an extraordinarie matter. And it is likely that it was then impoſed,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:4708:280"/>
when <hi>Xerxes</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> made his preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his voiage into <hi>Greece,</hi> for which he gathered ſo great an armie, to weete, of twentie hundred thouſand men, if we may beleeue <hi>Herodotus:</hi> for which action, there was of neceſſitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a huge maſſe of gold and ſiluer, and therefore there was neede of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie tributes and ſubſidies: from whence it ſeemeth that common prouerb ſprung among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a Father, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> a Lord, <hi>Darius</hi> an huckſter of the kingdome, as though he made retayle of his people. So that kings do not by any thing ſooner purchaſe the note of tyrannie, or of couetouſneſſe and filthie deſire of gaine, then by great &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie exactions vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſubiects, But why is there heere mention made of this tribute? It is likely that it is in regard of that which followeth, wherein is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in how great fauour and authoritie <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> was with the king, and that it might be ſignified that the Iewes were free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this tribute, which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt amplification &amp; increaſe of the peace and tranquillitie of the Church. In which matter the ſingular fauour of God doth

ſhine, who cauſeth the poore captiues to be ſpared, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the meane while the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſubiects of the kingdome are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſome with the labours &amp; dangers of war, ſome with exactions &amp; diminiſhing of their goods and ſubſtance. Lo what the grace and fauour of a wiſe Gouernour can do, in the ſparing of thoſe that haue moſt neede, ſuch as it is likely that the Iewes were, in compariſon of the naturall inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Wherefore <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnworthy praiſe or againſt his duty, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he procured their releaſe with eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care. I grant that ſome are not to be oppreſſed, that others may be releaſed, when the caſe is of thoſe burdens &amp; taxes which belong vnto the profit or defence of all: but yet there is no cauſe but that poore ſtrangers may wiſely relieue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from thoſe burdens which Princes exact of their naturall ſubiects. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> releaſed the familie of <hi>Iacob</hi> his father fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

faithfulneſſe and wiſdome which he had ſufficiently tried to be moſt neceſſarie and profitable for him &amp; his whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in the gouernment of the affayres of the realme. So that it was no marueile, if the king <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> for the like experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he had of the faithfulnes and diſcretion of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> profitable for the gouernment of his kingdome, did for his ſake make the Iewes free from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie tribute.</p>
               <p>More ouer the hiſtorie paſſeth ouer in ſilence the acts of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the dignitie of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> wherewith the king had magnified him: becauſe they are written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> There was indeede a great preparation made by <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his ſonne, but very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky as all hiſtories do obſerue: and the reſt of his acts the Chronicles of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> being loſt are now vnknowen. Now as touching <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that his wiſdome, faithfulnes, and watchfulnes, were ſufficiently tryed and approued by <hi>Aſſuerus;</hi> ſeeing that hee made ſo great account of him. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:4708:281"/>
ſometimes Princes do promote vnworthy men vpon ſodaine aduiſe and affection, which we haue ſeene in <hi>Haman,</hi> yet that dignitie continueth not long: for in ſhort ſpace they bewray either their pride and folly, or their wickedneſſe, and ſo in a moment fall headlong backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Wherefore it is certaine that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochaeus</hi> was adorned with vertues fit for that place and dignitie which he ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for otherwiſe being an alien, newly vpſtart, and lifted vp from baſe ſtate to ſo high honor, and procuring at his firſt comming to his eſtate that edict, by force and authoritie whereof the Iewes ſlewe ſeuentie and fiue thouſand of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at one maſſacre; it is ſure that hee was watched, and await layd for him, in ſo much that if he had not ſhewed great faithfulnes in his office, been moſt truſtie vnto the King, and moſt wiſe and vpright in his gouernement, he ſhould not long haue retained that dignitie. Nay if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all things had not had proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſe which hee dealt in, there would not haue wanted thoſe who would haue accuſed and ſlandered him as the cauſe of all the confuſions which might
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:4708:282"/>
ariſe in ſo great a monarchie. Therefore God did adorne him not onely with gifts meete and neceſſary to beare out ſo great a charge, but alſo did compaſſe him with ſpeciall grace and fauour, whereby hee might be ſafe from all the bitings of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and deſpight, and couered againſt all the falſe ſlanders and iniuries of the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. So was his gouernment profitable vnto the whole kingdome, and procured peace vnto the Church: whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, how great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him who ruleth the commonwelth in the feare of God, and him who is ruled by his affections. The gouernment of <hi>Haman</hi> was troubleſome to the Church, hurtfull to the people, diſhonourable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king, and hated of all men: but the rule of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> was profitable and peaceable vnto the Church, gaineful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kings ſubiects, and finally moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable vnto the king. Wherefore it is for the behoofe and profite of all States, that their gouernment be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto wiſe men fearing God: contrariwiſe it bringeth deſtruction vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if men am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, couetous, deſirous of reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and doing all things with paſſion for their own

threatned vnto any State, then when the wicked raigne and beare rule therein: or whereby happineſſe and good ſucceſſe is promiſed, then when godly men ſit chiefe in the gouernment thereof. Wherefore we are with moſt feruent prayers to craue at Gods hand, that the commonwealth may be gouerned by men that truly feare God, and that are carefull of publique peace and tranquillitie, reſpecting the common good, and not their owne profit.</p>
               <p>In fewe words are the dignitie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> ſet forth in the third verſe: his dignitie, <hi>that he was next vnto the King</hi> Aſſuerus, <hi>and great among the Iewes:</hi> his vertue, <hi>that he was accepted of all his brethren, procured the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and ſpake peaceablie to all his ſeede.</hi> It was no ſmall honor to poſſeſſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place of dignitie to the king, in ſo mightie and flouriſhing a Monarchie: ſo that he had neede to be furniſhed with rare, exquiſite, and heroicall vertues, to be able to guide the affaires of ſo great an eſtate with prayſe and honor. But it was a farre greater honor and dignitie vnto him to be a member of the Church; and to retaine true godlineſſe and religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:4708:283"/>
the delicacies and riot of ſo great a court, then to be the Viceroy of ſo high a Monarch. Of this mind was <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 48. 1.</note> he more eſteemed to haue his children partakers of <hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſſing, then of all the riches of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The like alſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did, who <hi>had rather ſuffer with the</hi>

Daniel</hi> alſo in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> had rather endanger his life in the Lyons iawes, then neglect his duetie in praying vnto God. It is not ſayd, how long this dignitie of <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> laſted, but it is likely that it endured vnto his death, to the profit and commoditie of the Church of God: wherefore God alſo bleſſed the Monarchie of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> becauſe his Church therein had a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſeate. So God is wont to bleſſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Kingdomes in which his Church is harboured, with quiet and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and he doth diuers times chooſe out ſome of his Church to be rulers, that thereby the peace of the Church may the better be confirmed and eſtabliſhed. And who can hinder the purpoſe of God, but that he may promote whome pleaſeth him to the higheſt top of honor?

               </p>
               <p>Of the vertues of <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> the firſt is gentleneſſe and curteſie, whereby hee was accepted of all his brethren. For i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For what greater thing I pray, can they performe, then to preſerue that people which God hath choſen vnto himſelf for his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; as a moſt pretious iewel? by what meanes can their memories be more highly commended?

Finally, <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> ſpake peace or proſperitie to all the ſeede of the Iewes: that is, he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them againſt the time to come, and tooke care that after his death the ſtate of the Church ſhould proſper &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine flouriſhing: which care aſſuredly doth eſpecially beſeeme thoſe whom God hath called to ſuch publike places.

By theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues was <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> great among the Iewes, and left behinde him an happie and bleſſed memorie for euer.</p>
               <p>It remayneth that wee gather into a briefe ſumme, thoſe things which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly haue bene hitherto expounded. The principall ſcope and drift of this booke is, that God might ſet before our eyes the care which he bare towards his Church in the time of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered it from the conſpiracie of <hi>Haman,</hi> and gaue it a notable victorie ouer all her enemies. The end of this deliuerance, as alſo of all other which God at ſundrie times beſtowed on his people, is this, that we may learne in the time of affliction and perſecution, to hope and looke for
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:4708:285"/>
help, ſuccour and deliuerance from God alone, who ſendeth it vnto his when it is moſt conuenient time, euen as we haue ſeene it to come to paſſe in al the regions about vs, as in <hi>Swizerland, Germanie; Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> in which, when as there haue bene troubles rayſed for religion, God hath deliuered thoſe Churches, and giuen them peace and tranquillitie. Whereupon <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> ought to be rayſed vp with good hope of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, which this long while, and at ſundrie times, haue ſuſtained the burden of moſt cruell perſecutions and ſharpe warres. We haue ſeene then for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the greatnes of this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the largeneſſe of the empire of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus</hi> deſcribed in the firſt chapter, and the magnificence &amp; exceſſe of his feaſts. The end of which feaſts was lamentable and vnluckie, the Queene <hi>Vaſhti</hi> refuſing to come at the Kings commandement, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was diuorced, that ſo there might a way be prepared to the taking in of <hi>Ester,</hi> which is declared in the ſecond Chapter, together with the benefite wrought by <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> for the King; God ſo before hand prepating fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:4708:286"/>
for the bringing to nought of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> wicked deuiſes: which things in the third chapter wee haue diſcuſſed. For when as he was lifted vp by the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all his courtiers, and was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all ſauing <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> he tooke ſo great indignation at it, that he tooke counſaile how to make away <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus,</hi> and the whole nation of the Iewes at one ſlaughter. To which purpoſe by his falſe accuſations and ſlanders, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned of the king an edict, whereby partly by <hi>Hamans</hi> falſe ſuggeſtions, and <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> ouer great credulitie, the Church was layd open to be ſpoyled and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without any difference of men or women, children, or infants. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publiſhed and made knowen, the Iewes turned themſelues vnto mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, weeping, faſting, and praying, and namely <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who left not to vrge and ſolicit <hi>Eſter,</hi> vntill he had perſwaded her to make ſupplication vnto the King for her people. Which thing ſhe did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three dayes and three nights faſt, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, as well by her ſelfe, as by all the Iewes inhabitants of <hi>Suſa.</hi> Wee haue
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:4708:286"/>
ſeene the effect of theſe prayers: that by them there was an entrie made open for <hi>Ester</hi> vnto the King, ſhee found fauour in his ſight, with great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of obtaining whatſoeuer ſhe ſhould demaund, euen vnto the halfe of the kingdome. But ſhee was content at the firſt, to requeſt the King and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to come vnto her to a banket: and then deſired none other thing, but that the next day it would be the Kings pleaſure to come the next day vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother banket. In the meane while <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tooke counſaile ſpeedily to make away <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> and by the aduiſe of his friends erected a gallowes, that the next day they might hang <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> thereon: but as in the ſixt Chapter is ſhewed, God turned his counſayle to a contrarie effect: the King comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to leade <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> through the ſtreetes of the citie with that great honor, which <hi>Haman</hi> himſelfe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: whereupon returning ſad and full of indignation vnto his houſe, he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from his friends the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we haue declared in the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:4708:287"/>
7. chapter, &amp; which at the Queenes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and petition was fulfilled, <hi>Haman</hi> being hanged on that ſame gallowes which he had prepared: and this was alſo beſides, a great effect of the prayer and repentance of the Iewes: but farre greater did follow in the eight Chapter, wherein is declared, that the riches and goods of <hi>Haman</hi> came vnto <hi>Eſter,</hi> and his honors vnto <hi>Mardochaeus:</hi> and there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie edict vnto the former written in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Iewes, whereupon the Iewes were made partakers of ioy and publicke gladnes as in the ninth Chapter. We haue heard alſo how the Iewes performed the matter, being authoriſed by the Kings Proclamation, and ſlew ſeuentie and fiue thouſand and eight hundred of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſought the goods and the liues of them, their wiues and children; ſo that the reſt of the people being made afrayd, dared not once to open their mouthes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iewes, God reſtraining their minds, and as it were compaſſing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a wall of fire. Which ſingular benefit of the Lords, <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> with <hi>Eſter</hi> the Queene, magnifying as they
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:4708:287"/>
were bound, and fearing leaſt in ſhort time the memorie thereof would decay, did by their authoritie and proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, commaund that the fourteenth and fifteenth dayes of that moneth wherein their enemies were ſlaine, ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with a perpetual feſtiuitie, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the dayes of <hi>Purim:</hi> becauſe the lots which <hi>Haman</hi> caſt, did appoynt thoſe dayes for the vtter deſtruction of the Iewes; but God had heard the cries and faſtes of his, &amp; had returned on the heads of the enemies, the miſchiefes which they had deuiſed for others. Finally, we haue ſeene that the power and honour which before were <hi>Hamans,</hi> and after beſtowed by <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> the King vpon <hi>Mardochae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> were more and more encreaſed and confirmed: and peace and tranquillitie procured vnto the Church then diſperſed among ſo many Nations. Out of al which we learne, being taught by experience of Gods goodneſſe, that in the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, &amp; moſt dangerous and deſperate caſes, our truſt is to be repoſed in God: whoſe power is ſo great, and confirmed vnto vs by ſo many proofes, that it is not
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:4708:288"/>
to be doubted, but that he wil moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully deliuer vs out of all daungers, if we crie vnto him: yea and which more is, Satan and all the world in vaine wringing at it, he will giue vnto vs eternall life, which that moſt precious bloud of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord ſhead once vpon the Croſſe, hath purchaſed for vs. To him alone be all glorie, praiſe, and all power and ſtrength for euer.</p>
               <closer>Amen.
Glorie be to God alone.</closer>
